# Event collection{#event-collection}

Events generated by the information system can be collected using two modes:

* calls to SOAP methods let you push events in Adobe Campaign: the PushEvent method lets you send one event at a time, the PushEvents method lets you send several at once. Refer to [Event description](../../message-center/using/event-description.md).
* creating a workflow lets you recover events by importing files or via an SQL gateway (with the **Federated Data Access** option).

Once they are collected, events are broken down - by technical workflows - between real time and batch queues of the execution instances, while waiting to be linked to a message template.
