# Purge events{#purging-events}

You can use the [deployment wizard](../../production/using/database-cleanup-workflow.md#deployment-wizard) to configure how long the data is to be stored in the database.

Event purging is carried out automatically by the [Database cleanup workflow](../../production/using/database-cleanup-workflow.md). This workflow purges the events received and stored on the execution instances and events archived on a control instance.

Use the arrows as appropriate to change the purge settings.
