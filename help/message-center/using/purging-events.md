# Purging events{#purging-events}

You can use the deployment wizard to configure how long the data is to be stored in the database.

Event purging is carried out automatically by the **Database cleanup** workflow. This workflow purges the events received and stored on the execution instances and events archived on a control instance.

Use the arrows as appropriate to change the purge settings.

Event purge settings on a control instance:
