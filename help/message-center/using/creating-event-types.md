# Creating event types{#creating-event-types}

Event types destined to be processed by Adobe Campaign must be created in the control instance. This can be done via the **[!UICONTROL Administration > Platform > Enumerations]** folder of the tree. Each event type matches a value in the **[!UICONTROL eventType]** enumeration. This can be an order confirmation, password or order delivery change, etc.

For more on itemized lists, refer to [Enumeration management](../../platform/using/managing-enumerations.md).

Once the itemized list values have been created, log off and back on to your instance for the creation to be effective.
