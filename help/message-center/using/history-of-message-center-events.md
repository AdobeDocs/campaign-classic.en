# History of Message Center events {#history-of-message-center-events}

The **[!UICONTROL History of Message Center events]** report provides you with an overview of the Message Center activity, i.e. the number of events processed and delivered as transactional messages.

When the report is opened, the information displayed by default coincides with the rate of successfully sent transactional messages. To view more levels, you can open the various nodes and place your cursor on the appropriate level to select it.
