# Monitoring thresholds{#monitoring-thresholds}

You can configure the warning thresholds (orange) and alert thresholds (red) of the indicators that appear in the **Message Center service level** and **Message Center processing time** reports (refer to [About transactional messaging reports](https://helpx.adobe.com/campaign/standard/message-center/using/about-transactional-messaging-reports.html)). To do this, open the deployment wizard of the execution instance, go to the **[!UICONTROL Message Center]** page and use the arrows to change the thresholds.
