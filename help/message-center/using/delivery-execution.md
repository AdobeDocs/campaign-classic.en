# Delivery execution{#delivery-execution}

>[!NOTE]
>
>The MTA prioritizes processing the transactional messages over any other delivery.

On the execution instance, once the enrichment stages are complete and a delivery template has been linked to the event, the delivery is sent. All deliveries are grouped in the **Administration > Production > Message Center > Default > Deliveries** folder.

By default, they are sorted into sub-folders by delivery month.

This sort can be changed in the message template properties as shown below.
