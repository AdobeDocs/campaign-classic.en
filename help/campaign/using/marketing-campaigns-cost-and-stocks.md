# Calculation of costs and stocks {#calculation-of-costs-and-stocks}

The file extraction launches two operations: budget calculation and stock calculation. The budget entries are updated.

* The **[!UICONTROL Budget]** tab lets you manage the budgets for the campaign. The total of the cost entries is shown in the **[!UICONTROL Calculates cost]** field of the campaign's main tab and the program it belongs to. The amounts are also reflected in the campaign budget.

  The real cost will eventually be calculated from information supplied by the router. Only messages actually sent are invoiced.

* Stocks are defined in the **[!UICONTROL Administration > Campaign management > Stocks]** node of the tree, and cost structures in the **[!UICONTROL Administration > Campaign management > Service providers]** node.

  Stock lines are visible in the stock section. To define the initial stock, open a stock line. The stock is decremented each time a delivery takes place. You can define an alert level and notifications.

>For further information about cost calculations and stock management, see [Providers, stocks and budgets](../../campaign/using/providers--stocks-and-budgets.md).
