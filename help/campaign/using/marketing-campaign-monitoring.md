# Monitor marketing campaigns {#monitoring-marketing-campaigns}

## Track a campaign {#tracking-a-campaign}

For each campaign, the **[!UICONTROL Tracking]** tab lets you view all jobs and their statuses. The following information is accessible via this sub-tab:

* The activity journal shows the jobs carried out on the campaign in general: workflow creation or start, approval, extraction, etc.

* The **[!UICONTROL Deliveries]** sub-tab contains all the deliveries of the campaign which can be edited from this view. To do so, select the delivery and click the **[!UICONTROL Detail]** icon.
