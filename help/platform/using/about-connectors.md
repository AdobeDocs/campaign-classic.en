# Campaign connectors {#about-connectors}

Adobe Campaign provides several connectors that allow you to communicate with external applications, connect to database engines, and integrate with Adobe Analytics to share data.

Available connectors are listed below:

* The **Federated Data Access (FDA) Connector** enables you to connect Campaign to one or more external databases and process information stored into them without affecting your Campaign data. [Learn more](../../installation/using/about-fda.md).
* The CRM connectors enable to exchange data between Adobe Campaign and your CRM solution using dedicated workflow activities. [Learn more](../../platform/using/crm-connectors.md).
* The Analytics Connector enables you to share data between Adobe Campaign and Adobe Analytics. [Learn more](../../integrations/using/gs-aa.md).

You can also integrate Campaign with multiple other systems, such as:

* Adobe Experience Cloud solutions: Adobe Experience Manager, Adobe Target, Adobe Audience Manager, Experience Cloud triggers, etc. [Learn more](../../integrations/using/about-campaign-integrations.md)
* Adobe Identity Management System (IMS) for Single-sign-on (SSO), to secure access to your Campaign instance, and connect to Adobe Campaign with the same Adobe ID as for the other Adobe Experience Cloud solutions. [Learn more](../../integrations/using/about-adobe-id.md).
* LDAP directory, to unify access management. [Learn more](../../installation/using/connecting-through-ldap.md).
