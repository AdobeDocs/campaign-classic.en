# About connectors{#about-connectors}

Adobe Campaign provides several connectors that allow you to communicate with external applications, connect to database engines, and integrate with Adobe Analytics to share data.

These connectors are:

* FDA Connector (**Federated Data Access**) enables you to connect Campaign to one or more external databases and process information stored into them without affecting your Campaign data. [Learn more](https://helpx.adobe.com/campaign/classic/platform/using/accessing-an-external-database.html).
* CRM connectors enable to exchange data between Adobe Campaign and your CRM solution using dedicated workflow activities. [Learn more](https://helpx.adobe.com/campaign/classic/platform/using/crm-connectors.html).
* Analytics Data Connectors (was **Adobe Genesis**) enables you to share data between Adobe Campaign and Adobe Analytics. [Learn more](https://helpx.adobe.com/campaign/classic/platform/using/adobe-analytics-data-connector.html).

You can also integrate Campaign with multiple other systems, such as:

* Adobe Experience Cloud solutions: Adobe Experience Manager, Adobe Target, Adobe Audience Manager, Experience Cloud triggers, etc. [Learn more](https://helpx.adobe.com/campaign/classic/integrations/using/about-campaign-integrations.html)
* Adobe IMS/SSO, to secure access to your Campaign instance, and connect to Adobe Campaign with the same Adobe ID as for the other Adobe Experience Cloud solutions. [Learn more](https://helpx.adobe.com/campaign/classic/integrations/using/about-adobe-id.html).
* LDAP directory, to unify access management. [Learn more](https://helpx.adobe.com/campaign/classic/installation/using/connecting-through-ldap.html).
