## Use workflows{#use-workflows}

Exports and imports are configured in dedicated templates executed through workflows via import and export activities. They can be repeated automatically according to a schedule, for example to automate data exchange between several information systems. [Learn more](../../platform/using/import-export-workflows.md#best-practices-when-importing-data)

If necessary, you can create an occasional import or export job via the **[!UICONTROL Generic imports and exports]** feature described below.

## Create jobs{#create-jobs}

To configure and execute data imports and exports jobs, go to the **[!UICONTROL Profiles and targets]** tab and click the **[!UICONTROL Jobs]** link. [Learn more](../../platform/using/about-generic-imports-exports.md)
