# Importing and exporting profiles{#exporting-and-importing-profiles}

You can [use workflows](#use-workflows) to import or export recipients profiles into Adobe Campaign database, or set up [generic imports or export jobs](#create-jobs).

## Use workflows{#use-workflows}

Exports and imports are configured in dedicated templates executed through workflows via the **[!UICONTROL Import]** and **[!UICONTROL Export]** activities. They can be repeated automatically according to a schedule, for example to automate data exchange between several information systems. [Learn more](../../workflow/using/importing-data.md#best-practices-when-importing-data)

If necessary, you can create an occasional import or export job via the **[!UICONTROL Generic imports and exports]** feature described below.

## Create jobs{#create-jobs}

To configure and execute data imports and exports jobs, go to the **[!UICONTROL Profiles and targets]** tab and click the **[!UICONTROL Jobs]** link. [Learn more](../../platform/using/generic-imports-and-exports.md)
