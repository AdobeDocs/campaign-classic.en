# Manage enumerations{#managing-enumerations}

An enumeration (also called an itemized list) is a predefined list of values you can use to fill in certain fields. Enumerations help standardize field values, making data entry more consistent and simplifying queries. 

When defined, values are displayed in a drop-down list. A value can be selected directly or entered using predictive input, which suggests and completes matching entries. Some fields include predefined enumerations, and additional enumerations can be created if required.

Learn more how to **work with enumerations** in [Adobe Campaign v8 (console) documentation](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/campaign/campaign-v8/config/settings/enumerations){target=_blank}.
