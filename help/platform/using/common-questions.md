## 1. How can I upgrade Campaign to the latest version? {#how-can-i-upgrade-campaign-to-the-latest-version-}

Adobe Campaign Classic, specifically, uses a range of technology to deliver value. This combination of technologies requires you to upgrade your Campaign Classic instance(s) on a regular basis, to ensure the most up-to-date versions are being used to deliver superior security, stability, and performance.

If you are using Adobe Managed Services, you can benefit from Campaign Gold Standard upgrade. For more on this refer to [this article](https://helpx.adobe.com/campaign/kb/gold-standard.html).

[Read out this article](https://helpx.adobe.com/campaign/kb/acc-build-upgrade.html) to learn how to update your environment and read [Common questions](https://helpx.adobe.com/campaign/kb/build-upgrade-faq.html) on this specific topic.

## 2. What is the database cleanup workflow? {#what-is-the-database-cleanup-workflow-}

The database cleanup workflow deletes obsolete data to avoid exponential growth of the database. This built-in technical workflow is triggered automatically without user intervention. It is accessible via the **[!UICONTROL Administration > Production > Technical workflows]** node of Campaign Explorer.

[Click here to learn more](../../production/using/database-cleanup-workflow.md) about database cleanup workflow.

## 3. How can I configure security zones? {#how-can-i-configure-security-zones-}

The Security Zones self-service interface can be used to manage entries in the VPN Security Zone configuration of an Adobe Campaign Classic deployment.

## 4. How can I make sure my delivery is sent without errors? {#how-can-i-make-sure-my-delivery-is-sent-without-errors-}

## 6. How can I connect to Campaign Classic? {#how-can-i-connect-to-campaign-classic-}

You can get the list of all systems and components supported for the latest build of Campaign in [Adobe Campaign Classic Compatibility matrix](https://helpx.adobe.com/campaign/kb/compatibility-matrix.html).

## 9. What is the procedure for domain delegation? {#what-is-the-procedure-for-domain-delegation-}

A subdomain is a division of your domain that can be used to isolate your brands, or various types of traffic (transactional messages, marketing information, etc.).
Adobe takes account of the Domain Name System (DNS) for email delivery, which allows the client to keep their brand image by using a DNS alias with its domain names, and Adobe to autonomously implement all the technical best practices that allow it to optimize deliverability during emailing.

[Click here to learn more](https://helpx.adobe.com/campaign/kb/domain-name-delegation.html).

As an  Admin user, you  can set up full domain delegation to Adobe through Campaign Control Panel. [Read more](https://docs.adobe.com/content/help/en/control-panel/using/subdomains-and-certificates/subdomains-branding.html).

## 10. How to get emails in the recipient's inbox? {#how-to-get-emails-in-the-recipient-s-inbox-}

Read out [Set up email deliverability](https://helpx.adobe.com/campaign/kb/acc-deliverability.html) getting started to learn the concepts and best practices related to deliverability as well as the tools to optimize sending your emails.
