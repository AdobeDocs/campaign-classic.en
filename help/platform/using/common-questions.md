[Click here to learn more](../../delivery/using/steps-validating-the-delivery.md).

### Why should I create proofs? {#why-should-i-create-proofs-}

Adobe highly recommends creating proof messages to test your delivery on an approval group before sending it to the main target. You can then validate message content, personalization and delivery parameters.

[Click here to learn more](../../delivery/using/steps-validating-the-delivery.md#sending-a-proof). You can also watch [this video](https://docs.campaign.adobe.com/doc/AC/en/Videos/seeds_sending_email_611.mp4).

### How to use seed addresses in Adobe Campaign? {#how-to-use-seed-addresses-in-adobe-campaign-}

Seed addresses are used to target recipients who do not match the defined target criteria. These recipients are added to the target: they can be imported or created directly in the delivery or the campaign. For direct mail deliveries, they are added during extraction and mixed in the output document.

This has the following benefits:

* Random substitution of fields with data from recipient profiles: this lets you enter only the email address, for instance in the seed address section.
* When using a workflow with data management functionalities, the additional data processed in deliveries can be entered at seed address level to force values: this sidesteps random value substitution.

[Click here to learn more on seed addresses](../../delivery/using/about-seed-addresses.md).

### How can I set up an approval process before sending messages? {#how-can-i-set-up-an-approval-process-before-sending-messages-}

To detect possible errors in message configuration, Adobe highly recommend setting up a delivery validation cycle. Make sure content is approved as often as necessary by sending proofs to test recipients. A proof should be sent each time a change is made, to approve content.

[Click here to learn more](../../delivery/using/steps-validating-the-delivery.md#sending-a-proof).

### What is a typology rule? {#what-is-a-typology-rule-}

### What are the best practices to define queries in Campaign? {#what-are-the-best-practices-to-define-queries-in-campaign-}

Adobe Campaign query editor is a powerful tool to explore data and build segments.

The Adobe Campaign query tool can be found on multiple levels of the software: to create a target population, segment customers, extract and filter tracking logs, build filters, etc.

You can query Campaign database using the generic query editor. It is accessed via the **Tools > Generic query editor...** menu. It lets you extract information stored in a database and organize, group, sort, etc. For instance, the user can recover recipients who clicked more than 'n' times on the link of a newsletter over a given period. This tool lets you collect, sort and display results based on your needs. This tool combines all Adobe Campaign querying possibilities. For instance, it lets you create and save restriction filters. This means that a user filter created in the Generic query editor can be used in the Query box of a targeting workflow, etc.

Queries are created using fields of the selected table or using a formula. Main principles to create a query on Campaign database are described [in this page](../../platform/using/about-queries-in-campaign.md).

[Click here](../../workflow/using/designing-queries.md) to discover Campaign query editor through a set of use cases.

### How can I import a data package? {#how-can-i-import-a-data-package-}

Adobe Campaign allows you to export or import the platform configuration and data through a package system. Data packages let entities of the Adobe Campaign database be displayed via files in XML format. Each entity contained in a package is represented with all of its data.

The principle of data packages is to export a data configuration and integrate it into another Adobe Campaign system.

Data management activities let you implement consistent management of all communications with a contact using information related to their contracts, subscriptions, reactivity to deliveries, etc. Data Management lets you track the data life cycle during segmentation operations, in particular:

* Simplifying and optimizing targeting processes, by including data that is not modeled in the datamart (creating new tables: local extension to each targeting workflow depending on configuration).
* Keeping and conveying buffer calculations, especially during target construction phases or for database administration.
* Accessing external bases (optional): heterogeneous databases taken into account during the targeting process.
