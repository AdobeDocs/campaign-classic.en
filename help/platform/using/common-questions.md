## 1. How can I upgrade Campaign to the latest version? {#how-can-i-upgrade-campaign-to-the-latest-version-}

Adobe Campaign Classic, specifically, uses a range of technology to deliver value. This combination of technologies requires you to upgrade your Campaign Classic instance(s) on a regular basis, to ensure the most up-to-date versions are being used to deliver superior security, stability, and performance.

If you are using Adobe Managed Services, you can benefit from Campaign [!DNL Gold Standard] upgrade. For more on this refer to [this article](../../rn/using/gs-overview.md).

[Read out this section](../../production/using/build-upgrade.md) to learn how to update your environment and read [Common questions](../../platform/using/faq-build-upgrade.md) on this specific topic.

## 2. What is the database cleanup workflow? {#what-is-the-database-cleanup-workflow-}

The database cleanup workflow deletes obsolete data to avoid exponential growth of the database. This built-in technical workflow is triggered automatically without user intervention. It is accessible via the **[!UICONTROL Administration > Production > Technical workflows]** node of Campaign Explorer.

## 9. What is the procedure for domain configuration? {#what-is-the-procedure-for-domain-delegation-}

A subdomain is a division of your domain that can be used to isolate your brands, or various types of traffic (transactional messages, marketing information, etc.).
Adobe takes account of the Domain Name System (DNS) for email delivery, which allows the client to keep their brand image by using a DNS alias with its domain names, and Adobe to autonomously implement all the technical best practices that allow it to optimize deliverability during emailing.
