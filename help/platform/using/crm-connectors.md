## Get started with CRM connectors {#about-crm-connectors}

Adobe Campaign provides various CRM connectors for linking your Adobe Campaign platform to your third-party systems. These CRM connectors enable you to synchronize contacts, accounts, purchases, etc. They make for easy integration of your application with various third-party and business applications.

These connectors enable quick and easy data integration: Adobe Campaign provides a dedicated wizard for collecting and selecting from the tables available in the CRM. This guarantees two-directional synchronization to make sure data is up-to-date at all times throughout the systems.
