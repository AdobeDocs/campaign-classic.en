# Launching Adobe Campaign{#launching-adobe-campaign}

Campaign Client console is a rich client which enables you to connect to your Campaign application server(s). Learn how to download and configure the client console in [this page](../../installation/using/installing-the-client-console.md).

## Starting Adobe Campaign {#starting-adobe-campaign}

You can start Adobe Campaign by selecting **[!UICONTROL Start / All Programs / Adobe Campaign v.X / Adobe Campaign client console]**.

The client console connection window lets you select or configure existing databases and connect to them using a user name and password:

## Connecting to Adobe Campaign {#connecting-to-adobe-campaign}

You can connect to Adobe Campaign using your Adobe ID. For more on this, refer to [this page](../../integrations/using/about-adobe-id.md).

You can also connect with a dedicated login/password:

1. Enter the operator account identifier in the **[!UICONTROL Login]** field.

   Your identifier is given by the administrator of your Adobe Campaign platform.

1. Enter your password in the **[!UICONTROL Password]** field.

   The first time you access the database, your password is the one given to you by the administrator. Once you are connected, you can change your password via the **[!UICONTROL Tools > Change password...]** menu. Details on operators and connections are available in [Access management](../../platform/using/access-management.md).

1. Click **[!UICONTROL LOG IN]** to confirm.<!--You can also press the **Enter** key to launch connection.-->

You can now access [Adobe Campaign workspace](../../platform/using/adobe-campaign-workspace.md).

Some keyboard shortcuts are available on the **[!UICONTROL Sign in screen]**:
* All actionable items are selectable through the **Tab** key (top to bottom) or the **Tab** + **Shift** keys (bottom to top).
* To launch connection, you can also press the **Enter** key.
* You can use the **Escape** key to reset the **[!UICONTROL Login]** and **[!UICONTROL Password]** fields to the last successful connection values.

## Setting up connections {#setting-up-connections}

You can access the server connection settings via the link above the input zone.

You must then define the connection settings. To do this:

1. Enter a **[!UICONTROL Label]** to assign a name to your database connection.

1. Add the address of the application server in the **[!UICONTROL URL]** field. If you do not know the connection URL, contact the administrator.

1. Check **[!UICONTROL Connect with an Adobe ID]** for the operators to connect to the console using their Adobe ID. For more on this, refer to [this page](../../integrations/using/about-adobe-id.md).

1. Click **[!UICONTROL OK]** to validate.

## Operators and permissions {#operators-and-permissions}

The identifiers and passwords of operators with access to the software and their respective permissions are defined by your Adobe Campaign system administrator in the **[!UICONTROL Administration > Access management > Operators]** node of the Adobe Campaign tree.

This functionality is detailed in the [Access management](../../platform/using/access-management.md) section.
