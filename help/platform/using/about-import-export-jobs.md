# About import and export templates {#about-import-export-templates}

Adobe Campaign offers a data export module that makes it easy to extract a list of customers or prospects (for example, following a targeting operation) who will then become part of a target population.

Adobe Campaign also offers an import module that lets you supply your database with data from external files.

You can:

* Create an import or export template and configure it (see below).
* Create an import or export: refer to [Exporting data](../../platform/using/launching-export-jobs.md) or [Importing data](../../platform/using/launching-import-jobs.md).
* Launch the import or export and monitor its execution. refer to [Execution tracking](#execution-tracking).
