# Use named rights to set up permissions{#named-rights}

 

By default, Adobe Campaign proposes a set of named rights that let you define the authorizations assigned to operators and groups of operators. These rights can be edited from the **[!UICONTROL Administration > Access management > Named rights]** node of the tree.

These rights are as follows:

* **[!UICONTROL APPROVAL ADMINISTRATION]**: You can set multiple approval steps within workflows and deliveries to ensure that the current state has been approved by an assigned operator or group. Users with the **[!UICONTROL APPROVAL ADMINISTRATION]** right can set approval steps and also assign an operator or operator group who should approve those steps.
