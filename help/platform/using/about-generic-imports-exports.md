# About generic imports and exports {#about-generic-imports-exports}

Adobe Campaign Classic provides generic imports and exports. They allow you, for example, to extract a list of customers or prospects who will then become part of a target population, or to supply your database with data from external files.

Generic imports and exports are managed from the **[!UICONTROL Profiles and Targets > Jobs > Generic imports and exports]** node of the Adobe Campaign tree.

The steps to perform generic import and export operations are as follows:

1. [Create an import or export template](../../platform/using/creating-import-export-templates.md) (optional).
1. [Create an import or export job](../../platform/using/creating-import-export-jobs.md).
1. Configure and execute the [import](../../platform/using/executing-import-jobs.md) or [export](../../platform/using/executing-export-jobs.md) job.
1. [Monitor](../../platform/using/monitoring-jobs-execution.md) the execution of the job.
