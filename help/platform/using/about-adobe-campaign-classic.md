### Integrated customer profile {#integrated-customer-profile}

Profiles (customers, prospects, newsletter subscribers, etc.) are centralized in the Adobe Campaign database. There are many possible mechanisms for acquiring profiles and building up this database: on-line collection via web forms, manual or automatic import of text files, replication with company databases or other information systems. With Adobe Campaign, you can incorporate marketing history, purchase information, preferences, CRM data, and any relevant PII data in a consolidated view to analyze and take action.

In Adobe Campaign, recipients are the default profiles targeted for sending deliveries (emails, SMS, etc.). Thanks to the recipient data that are stored in the database, you will be able to filter the target that will receive any given delivery and to add personalization data in your delivery contents. Other types of profiles exist in the database. They are designed for different uses. For example, seed profiles are made to test your deliveries before they are sent to the final target.

Profile management basics are explained in [About profiles](https://helpx.adobe.com/campaign/standard/platform/using/about-profiles.html).

### Targeted segmentation {#targeted-segmentation}

Adobe Campaign has powerful, user-friendly segmentation and targeting features that let you create highly targeted, differentiated offers. The descriptive analysis functionality lets you analyze information upstream and downstream of your marketing campaigns, and the filter management and [graphical query editor](https://helpx.adobe.com/campaign/classic/platform/using/about-queries-in-campaign.html) functionality lets you filter your subscriber population and sample or create target groups based on an unlimited number of criteria. The analysis and targeting features are described in [this page](https://helpx.adobe.com/campaign/classic/reporting/using/about-descriptive-analysis.html) and in the [Creating filters](https://helpx.adobe.com/campaign/standard/platform/using/creating-filters.html) section.

The advanced Data Management functionality extends the data processing capabilities. It simplifies and optimizes the targeting process by including data not modeled in the datamart. This functionality is detailed in [this page](https://helpx.adobe.com/campaign/classic/workflow/using/targeting-data.html#data-management).
