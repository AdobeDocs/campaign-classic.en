# Key concepts {#key-concepts}

Learn key steps to start with Adobe Campaign.

## Can I connect to Campaign Classic with an Adobe ID? {#can-i-connect-to-campaign-classic-with-an-adobe-id-}

Thanks to the integration with the IMS (Adobe Identity Management System), users can connect to the Adobe Campaign console using their Adobe ID. This integration provides the following advantages:

* The same ID can be used for all Experience Cloud solutions.
* The connection is memorized when using Adobe Campaign with different integrations.
* Securer password management policy.
* Use of Federated ID accounts (external ID provider).

## What is a workflow? {#what-is-a-workflow-}

Adobe Campaign includes workflows to orchestrate the full range of processes and tasks across the different modules of the application server. This comprehensive graphical environment lets you design processes including segmentation, campaign execution, file processing, human participation, etc. The workflow engine executes and tracks these processes.

You can use a workflow, for example, to download a file from a server, decompress it, and then import records contained within into the Adobe Campaign database.

A workflow can also involve one or more operators to be notified or who can make choices and approve processes. In this way, it is possible to create a delivery action, assign a task to one or more operators to work on content, specify targets, and to approve proofs before starting the delivery.
