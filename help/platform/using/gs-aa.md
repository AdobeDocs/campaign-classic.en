# Work with Adobe Campaign and Adobe Analytics {#adobe-analytics-connector-gs}

Adobe Analytics Connector allows Adobe Campaign and Adobe Analytics interact through the **[!UICONTROL Web Analytics connectors]** package. It forwards data to Adobe Campaign in the form of segments concerning user behavior following a campaign. Conversely, it sends indicators and attributes of campaigns delivered by Adobe Campaign to Adobe Analytics.

## Guardrails and prerequisites {#adobe-analytics-connector-guardrails}

Before starting working with the Adobe Campaign-Adobe Analytics connector, consider the following guardrails and prerequisites.

* For this integration, connecting to Campaign with Adobe Identity Management System (IMS) is required. [Learn more](../../integrations/using/about-adobe-id.md).

* Adobe Analytics Connector is not compatible with Transactional messaging (Message Center).

* The Web Analytics connector add-on must be installed on your environment, through the dedicated package.

    * For Hybrid and On-Premise implementations, make sure to follow the provisioning steps detailed in this [page](../../platform/using/adobe-analytics-provisioning.md).
    *  As a Hoster or Managed Cloud Services user, contact Adobe to connect Campaign with Adobe Experience Cloud services and solutions.
