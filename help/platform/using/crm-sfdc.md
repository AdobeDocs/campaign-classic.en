# Connect Campaign and Salesforce.com{#connect-to-sfdc}


   
In this page, you will learn how to connect Campaign Classic to **Salesforce**.

Data synchronization is carried out via a dedicated workflow activity. [Learn more](../../platform/using/crm-data-sync.md).


The external account allows you to import and export Salesforce data into Adobe Campaign.
To configure CRM Connector for Salesforce, follow the steps below:

1. Create a new external account via the **[!UICONTROL Administration > Platform > External accounts]** node of the Adobe Campaign tree.
1. Select **[!UICONTROL Salesforce.com]**.
1. Enter settings to enable connection.

    * **[!UICONTROL Password]**
    Password used to sign in to Salesforce CRM.

    * **[!UICONTROL Client identifier]**

    * **[!UICONTROL Security token]**
    To know where to find your security token, refer to this [page](https://help.salesforce.com/articleView?id=000205876&type=1).

    * **[!UICONTROL API version]**

1. Once the schema is created, you can synchronize enumerations automatically from Salesforce to Adobe Campaign.

   To do this, click the **[!UICONTROL Synchronizing enumerations...]** link and select the Adobe Campaign enumeration that matches the Salesforce enumeration.

   >You can replace all values of an Adobe Campaign enumeration with those of the CRM: to do this, select **[!UICONTROL Yes]** in the **[!UICONTROL Replace]** column.


   Click **[!UICONTROL Next]** and then **[!UICONTROL Start]** to start importing the list.

1. Check the imported values in the **[!UICONTROL Administration > Platform > Enumerations]** menu.

   > Multiple selection enumerations are not supported.

Campaign and Salesforce.com are now connected. You can set up data synchronization between the two systems. 

To synchronize data between Adobe Campaign data and SFDC, you need to create a workflow and use the **[!UICONTROL CRM connector]** activity.
