# Privacy management {#privacy-management}

Adobe Campaign offers a set of tools to help you comply with Privacy regulations (including GDPR, CCPA, PDPA, LGPD).

This article presents general information on what Privacy Management is and the features we provide to manage the new Right to Access and Right to be Forgotten. See [this section]().

On this page, you will also find information on important features to manage Privacy (consent, data retention and user roles - see [this section](#)), as well as best practices to help you with your Privacy compliance when using our service.

## Regulations on privacy management {#privacy-management-regulations}

Adobe Campaign's capabilities help you comply with the following regulations:

* GDPR ([General Data Protection Regulation](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/reform/what-does-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr-govern_en)) is the European Union’s (EU) privacy law that harmonizes and modernizes data protection requirements for EU's countries.
* CCPA ([California Consumer Privacy Act](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displayText.xhtml?lawCode=CIV&division=3.&title=1.81.5.&part=4.&chapter=&article=)) provides California residents new rights in regards to their personal information and imposes data protection responsibilities on certain entities whom conduct business in California.
* PDPA ([Personal Data Protection Act](https://secureprivacy.ai/thailand-pdpa-summary-what-businesses-need-to-know/)) is the new privacy law that harmonizes and modernizes data protection requirements for Thailand. 
* LGPD ([Lei Geral de Proteção de Dados](https://iapp.org/media/pdf/resource_center/Brazilian_General_Data_Protection_Law.pdf)) will be effective early 2021 for all companies collecting or processing personal data in Brazil.

All of these regulations apply to Adobe Campaign customers who hold data for Data Subjects residing in the respective regions or countries mentioned above (EU, California, Thailand, Brazil).

Several Privacy capabilities are already available in Adobe Campaign, including consent management, data retention settings, and rights management. See [Consent, Retention and Roles](). In addition to this, we are taking this opportunity in our role as Data Processor to include additional capabilities, to help facilitate your readiness as Data Controller for certain Privacy requests. See [Right to Access and Right to be Forgotten]().

For more on personal data and on the different entities that manage data (Data Controller, Data Processor and Data Subject), see [Personal data and Personas](../../platform/using/privacy-and-recommendations.md#personal-data).

## Right to Access and Right to be Forgotten {#right-access-forgotten}

In order to help you facilitate your Privacy readiness, Adobe Campaign now allows you to handle **Access** and **Delete** requests.

* The **Right to Access** is the right for the Data Subject to obtain from the Data Controller confirmation as to whether or not personal data concerning them is being processed, where and for what purpose. The Data Controller shall provide a copy of the personal data, free of charge, in an electronic format.

* Also known as Data Erasure, the **Right to be Forgotten** (delete request) entitles the Data Subject to have the Data Controller erase his/her personal data, cease further dissemination of the data, and potentially have third parties halt processing of the data.

To learn how you can create **Access** and **Delete** requests and how Adobe Campaign processes them, refer to the [implementation steps]() for Adobe Campaign Classic.

## Consent, Retention and Roles {#consent-retention-roles}

In addition to the new **Right to Access** and **Right to be Forgotten** capabilities, Adobe Campaign offers other important features that are essential to Privacy:

* **Consent management**: subscription functionality for preference management
* **Data retention**: data retention periods on all standard log tables, additional retention periods can be set up with workflows
* **Rights management**: data access managed by named right (Classic) and roles (Standard)

### Consent management {#consent-management}

Consent signifies agreement by the Data Subject to the processing of personal data relating to a Data Subject. Obtaining any necessary consent for that processing is the responsibility of the Data Controller. While Adobe Campaign may provide some features to help a customer manage consent related to the service, Adobe is not responsible for consent. Customers should work with their own legal departments to determine their own processes and practices for any necessary consent.

The features to help manage some aspects of consent have been core to Adobe Campaign since the beginning. Through our subscription management process, customers can track which recipients have opted-in to which type of subscriptions whether it be newsletters, daily or weekly promotions, or any other type of marketing program.
