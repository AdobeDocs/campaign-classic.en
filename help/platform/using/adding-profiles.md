# Adding profiles{#adding-profiles}

In most cases, profiles are [imported to Campaign through a workflow](../../workflow/using/importing-data.md). However, you can add one or more profiles directly from the interface, by clicking the **Create** button. They will then be added to the database.

Enter the information for this profile. The tabs and fields to be completed are described in [Editing a profile](../../platform/using/editing-a-profile.md).

Click **Save** to validate profile creation. The profile is then added in Adobe Campaign database.
