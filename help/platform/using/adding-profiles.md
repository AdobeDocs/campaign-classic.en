# Add profiles{#adding-profiles}



In most cases, profiles are [imported to Campaign through a workflow](../../platform/using/import-export-workflows.md). However, you can add one or more profiles directly from the interface, by clicking the **[!UICONTROL Create]** button. They will then be added to the database.
