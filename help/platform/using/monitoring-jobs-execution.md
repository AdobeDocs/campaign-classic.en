# Monitor jobs execution {#monitoring-job-execution}

 

You can track the execution of your import and export jobs directly from the list of import/export jobs.

* The **[!UICONTROL Journal]** tab lets you look at log messages concerning execution.
* The **[!UICONTROL Rejects]** tab contains the rejected records. See [this section](../../platform/using/executing-import-jobs.md#behavior-in-the-event-of-an-error).

In the **[!UICONTROL General]** tab, the **[!UICONTROL Status]** field indicates the current status of a job.

Each status is represented by a special icon and label. The statuses and their icons are listed below:
