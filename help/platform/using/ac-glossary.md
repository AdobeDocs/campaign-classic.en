# Adobe Campaign Glossary{#ac-glossary}

Below is the definition of the key terms and concepts in Adobe Campaign

## A - D{#sec-1}

+++**A/B testing**

A/B test is a capability which lets the user define two to three email variants: each variant is sent to population samples in order to determine which has the best result. Once determined, the winning variant is then sent to the remaining population.

Learn more about [A/B testing](../../delivery/using/get-started-a-b-testing.md).

+++**Access management**

Access management enables admins to assign access and permissions to users of Adobe Campaign. Permissions include the ability to view and/or use Adobe Campaign features, such as executing workflows, defining schemas, and managing audiences

Learn more about [Access management](access-management.md).

+++**Activity**

An activity is a palette item which is added to a workflow to define an execution functionality. The activity is a container that executes a Task. In a workflow, a given activity can produce multiple tasks, in particular when there is a loop or recurrent (periodic) actions.

+++**Eligibility rules**

*Context: Campaign Interaction*

Eligibility rules are constraints applied to an environment, category or offer concerning the validity period, target and weight. They let Operators ensure that an offer is in line with the targeted contact.  In the offer environment, eligibility rules include presentation rules applied to the offers and the recipients to target.  In the category, eligibility rules let Operators limit the validity of the category in time, define application themes and determine the recipients to target. They can also define a multiplier weight for a given period of time. This lets Operators share the rules for offers in other categories and so simplifies their management.  In an offer, eligibility rules let Operators limit the validity of offers in time and determine the recipients to target.
