# Adobe Campaign Glossary{#ac-glossary}

Below is the definition of the key terms and concepts in Adobe Campaign, with links to related documentation. Click a term to display its definition.

## A - D{#sec-1}

+++**A/B testing**

A/B test is a capability which lets the user define two to three email variants: each variant is sent to population samples in order to determine which has the best result. Once determined, the winning variant is then sent to the remaining population.

Learn more about [A/B testing](../../delivery/using/get-started-a-b-testing.md).
+++

+++**Access management**

Access management enables admins to assign access and permissions to users of Adobe Campaign. Permissions include the ability to view and/or use Adobe Campaign features, such as executing workflows, defining schemas, and managing audiences.

Learn more about [Access management](access-management.md).
+++


+++**Activity**

An activity is a palette item which is added to a workflow to define an execution functionality. The activity is a container that executes a Task. In a workflow, a given activity can produce multiple tasks, in particular when there is a loop or recurrent (periodic) actions.

Learn more about [Workflow activities](../../workflow/using/about-activities.md).
+++

+++**ACS Connector**

ACS Connector (Prime Offering) bridges Adobe Campaign v7 and Adobe Campaign Standard. It is an integrated feature in Campaign v7 that automatically replicates data to Campaign Standard, uniting the best of both applications. Campaign v7 has advanced tools to manage the primary marketing database. The data replication from Campaign v7 allows Campaign Standard to leverage the rich data in a user-friendly environment.

+++

+++**Active profile**

Profiles are considered active if they have been targeted or communicated with in the past 12 months via any channel. According to your contract, each of your Campaign instances is provisioned with a specific number of active profiles that are counted for billing purposes.

Learn more about [Active profiles](about-profiles.md#active-profiles).
+++


+++**Approval workflow activity**

*Context: Campaign Distributed Marketing*

The Local Approval activity is a workflow activity which is used to set up a delivery approval process before the messages are sent.

Learn more about the [Local Approval Activity](../../workflow/using/local-approval.md).
+++

+++**Audience**

An audience is the resulting set of profiles that meet the criteria of a filter definition, based on rules and attributes. 

Learn more about [Audiences](../../campaign/using/marketing-campaign-target.md).
+++

+++**Audit trail**

Audit trail captures, in real-time, a comprehensive list of actions and events occurring within your Adobe Campaign instance. It includes a self-serve way to access a history of data to help answer questions such as: what happened to your workflows, and who last updated them or what did your users do in the instance.

## E - H {#sec-2}

+++**Eligibility rules**

*Context: Campaign Interaction*

Eligibility rules are constraints applied to an environment, category or offer concerning the validity period, target and weight. They let Operators ensure that an offer is in line with the targeted contact.  In the offer environment, eligibility rules include presentation rules applied to the offers and the recipients to target.  In the category, eligibility rules let Operators limit the validity of the category in time, define application themes and determine the recipients to target. They can also define a multiplier weight for a given period of time. This lets Operators share the rules for offers in other categories and so simplifies their management.  In an offer, eligibility rules let Operators limit the validity of offers in time and determine the recipients to target. 

Learn more about [Eligibility rules](../../interaction/using/interaction-and-offer-management.md).
