Learn how to orchestrate processes and tasks with Adobe Campaign workflows.

## What are the key steps to create a workflow? {#what-are-the-key-steps-to-create-a-workflow-}

[Click here to learn how to create your first workflow](../../workflow/using/building-a-workflow.md): learn concepts and best practices to build workflows in Campaign.

## How can I import data in Campaign? {#how-can-i-import-data-in-campaign-}

Learn best practices to import data in [this section](../../platform/using/import-export-best-practices.md).

## Can I monitor workflow execution? {#can-i-monitor-workflow-execution-}

Understand how to monitor Campaign workflow execution [in this page](../../workflow/using/starting-a-workflow.md).

## How can I update Campaign data with a workflow? {#how-can-i-update-campaign-data-with-a-workflow-}

You can perform massive update, merge and insert on the data in the database.

[Click here to learn more](../../workflow/using/update-data.md).

## How can I leverage data management capabilities? {#how-can-i-leverage-data-management-capabilities-}

In Adobe Campaign, you can leverage a set of activities for solving complex targeting issues by offering more efficient and flexible tools. Data management activities let you implement consistent management of all communications with a contact using information related to their contracts, subscriptions, reactivity to deliveries, etc. Data Management lets you track the data life cycle during segmentation operations, in particular:

* Simplifying and optimizing targeting processes, by including data that is not modeled in the datamart (creating new tables: local extension to each targeting workflow depending on configuration).
* Keeping and conveying buffer calculations, especially during target construction phases or for database administration.
* Accessing external bases (optional): heterogeneous databases taken into account during the targeting process.

[Click here to learn more](../../workflow/using/targeting-data.md#data-management) and be able to design complex target and work on your data combining data management workflow activities.

## Can I automate personalized messages sending? {#can-i-automate-personalized-messages-sending-}

Read out [this use case](../../workflow/using/enriching-data.md) to send personalized messages to people depending on their highest scores of a competition.

## How can I split an audience in subsets with a workflow? {#how-can-i-split-an-audience-in-subsets-with-a-workflow-}

Learn how to split a target into several subsets [in this section](../../workflow/using/split.md).

## How can I update recipient data from an external file? {#how-can-i-update-recipient-data-from-an-external-file-}

You can modify certain fields in a Campaign table with values from an external text file.

[Click here to learn how](../../platform/using/import-operations-samples.md#example--enrich-the-values-with-those-of-an-external-file).

## How can I identify and target new recipients? {#how-can-i-identify-and-target-new-recipients-}

[This use case](../../workflow/using/using-aggregates.md) will learn you how to use aggregates to automatically identify last recipients added in the database and send them a welcome message.
