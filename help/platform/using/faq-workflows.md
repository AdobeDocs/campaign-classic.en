## How can I leverage data management capabilities? {#how-can-i-leverage-data-management-capabilities-}

In Adobe Campaign, you can leverage a set of activities for solving complex targeting issues by offering more efficient and flexible tools. Data management activities let you implement consistent management of all communications with a contact using information related to their contracts, subscriptions, reactivity to deliveries, etc. Data Management lets you track the data life cycle during segmentation operations, in particular:

* Simplifying and optimizing targeting processes, by including data that is not modeled in the datamart (creating new tables: local extension to each targeting workflow depending on configuration).
* Keeping and conveying buffer calculations, especially during target construction phases or for database administration.
* Accessing external bases (optional): heterogeneous databases taken into account during the targeting process.

Learn how to design complex target and work on your data combining data management workflow activities in the [Campaign v8 documentation](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/campaign/automation/workflows/introduction/wf-type/targeting-workflows.html){target="_blank"}.
