# Get started with permissions{#access-management}

Adobe Campaign lets you define and manage the rights assigned to the various operators. These are a set of rights and restrictions that authorize or deny:

* Access to certain functionalities (via the named rights),
* Access to certain records,
* Creation, modification and/or deletion of records (actions, contacts, campaigns, groups, etc.).

The permissions apply to operator profiles or operator groups.

They are completed by safety parameters linked to the operator's connection mode to Adobe Campaign. For more about security zones in [this page](../../installation/using/security-zones.md).

There are two types of permissions you can grant to a user:

* You can define groups of operators to which you attribute rights, then associate the operators with one or more groups. This enables you to reuse rights and make operator profiles more consistent. It also facilitates the management and maintenance of profiles. Group creation and management are presented in [this section](access-management-groups.md).

* You can attribute named rights directly to users, in some cases to overload the rights allocated via groups. These rights are presented in [this page](access-management-named-rights.md).

>Before starting defining permissions, Adobe recommends you to read the [Security configuration checklist](https://helpx.adobe.com/campaign/kb/acc-security.html).
