# Specific configurations from v6.02 to v7{#specific-configurations-in-v6-02}

![](../../assets/v7-only.svg)

The following section details the additional configuration required when migrating from v6.02. You should also configure the settings detailed in [this page](../../migration/using/general-configurations.md).

## Web applications {#web-applications}

If you are migrating from v6.02, error logs regarding overview-type web applications may appear. Error message examples:

```
[PU-0006] Entity of type : 'xtk:entityBackupNew' and Id 'nms:webApp|taskOverview', expression '[SQLDATA[' was found : '...)) or (@id IN ([SQLDATA[select 
[PU-0006] Entity of type : 'xtk:formDictionary' and Id 'nms:webApp|lastTasks', expression '[SQLDATA[' was found : '...)) or (@id IN ([SQLDATA[select 
[PU-0006] Entity of type : 'nms:webApp' and Id 'taskOverview', expression '[SQLDATA[' was found : '...@owner-id] IN ([SQLDATA[select iGroupid...'. (iRc=-1)
```

These web applications used SQLData and are not compatible with v7, due to heightened security. These errors will lead to a migration failure.

If you didn't use these web applications, run the following cleanup script and rerun the postupgrade:

```
Nlserver javascript -instance:[instance_name] -file [installation_path]/datakit/xtk/fra/js/removeOldWebApp.js
```

If you have modified these web applications and would like to continue using them in v7, you must activate the **allowSQLInjection** option in your different security zones and re-start the postupgrade. Refer to the [SQLData](../../migration/using/general-configurations.md#sqldata) section for more on this.

## Message Center {#message-center}

After a Message Center control instance migration, you must republish the transactional message templates for them to work.

In v7, the names of transactional message templates on execution instances have changed. They are currently prefixed by the operator name that corresponds to the control instance on which they are created, for example **control1_template1_rt** (where **control1** is the name of the operator). If you have a significant volume of templates, we recommend deleting old templates on control instances.
