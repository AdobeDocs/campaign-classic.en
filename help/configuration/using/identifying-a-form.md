# Identify a form{#identifying-a-form}

![](../../assets/common.svg)

An input form lets you edit an instance associated with a data schema from the Adobe Campaign client console.

The form is identified by its name and namespace.

The identification key of a form is a string made up of the namespace and the name separated by a colon (':') (for example: "cus:contact").
