# Creating filters{#creating-filters}

Just like the out-of-the-box recipient table provided with Adobe Campaign, the new recipient table may receive a batch of predefined filters.

These filters will be available in the target selection window with the same functionalities as segments for recipients (using parameter input forms, folders, etc.).

1. Go to the **[!UICONTROL Administration > Configuration > Predefined filters]** node.
1. Create a new filter.
1. Enter the **[!UICONTROL Label]** of the filter, then select the schema which matches the external recipient table in the **[!UICONTROL Document type]** field.
1. Create your **[!UICONTROL filtering conditions]** based on the fields of your schema.
1. Save the filter.
