# Creating filters{#creating-filters}

Just like the out-of-the-box recipient table provided with Adobe Campaign, the new recipient table may receive a batch of predefined filters.

These filters will be available in the target selection window with the same functionalities as segments for recipients (using parameter input forms, folders, etc.).

1. Go to the **Administration > Configuration > Predefined filters** node.
1. Create a new filter.
1. Enter the **Label** of the filter, then select the schema which matches the external recipient table in the **Document type** field.
1. Create your **filtering conditions** based on the fields of your schema.
1. Save the filter.
