# Creating a profile list with a workflow{#creating-a-profile-list-with-a-workflow}


To create a **[!UICONTROL List]** type list based on the new recipient table, you need to create a targeting workflow which will generate the list. 

For more information about lists in Campaign, refer to [this section](../../platform/using/creating-and-managing-lists.md#about-lists-in-adobe-campaign).

To create a targeting workflow and update recipients in a custom recipient table, follow the steps below: 

1. Go to the **[!UICONTROL Profiles and Targets > Jobs > Targeting workflows]** node of the explorer.
1. Create a new targeting workflow.
1. Place a **Query** activity followed by a **List update** activity.
