## What is [!DNL Gold Standard]?

Adobe and Adobe Campaign is committed to providing you with the best experience and value through our software solution(s). The organization is committed to ensuring that you have access to the most current versions of related technology that our solutions leverage to perform its tasks.

Adobe Campaign Classic, specifically, uses a range of technology to deliver value. This combination of technologies requires you to upgrade your Campaign Classic instance(s) on a regular basis, to ensure the most up-to-date versions are being used to deliver superior security, stability, and performance.

[!DNL Gold Standard] is Campaign Classic Long-Term support release. As a hosted [!DNL Gold Standard] user, you automatically benefit from the [!DNL Gold Standard] upgrade with the latest stable version without any action. On-premise and Hybrid customers can also benefit from [!DNL Gold Standard] releases. If you migrate from an old build, we recommend that you upgrade to this version first.

## Why does my organization need this upgrade?

As a hosted customer, if your account has been identified as needing to upgrade one or more of the technologies related to Campaign Classic, as well as updating the current build and/or version, you will be notified directly in by Adobe.

As an on-premise or hybrid customer running on an older version, Adobe encourages you to move to the latest [!DNL Gold Standard].

This will ensure that your account is secure from vulnerabilities, as well as leveraging updated performance technology. This upgrade will also position your account for easier, regular upgrades going forward that will require less manual work and intervention.

## What is the process and timeline for this upgrade?

The Adobe team will lead and guide your organization through this journey.

We have organized a team of dedicated Customer Care Reps, Product Managers, Engineers and TechOps Specialists, and Product Consultants to assist and ensure the experience is smooth.

We are committed to making sure you have the relevant project and contact information.
