GDPR applies to Adobe Campaign customers who hold data for Data Subjects residing in the EU.</p> <p>In addition to the privacy capabilities already available in Adobe Campaign (including consent management, data retention settings, and user roles), we are taking this opportunity in our role as Data Processor to include additional capabilities, to help facilitate your readiness as Data Controller for certain GDPR requests:</p>

**Security enhancements**

* Expansion of external entities is now disabled to prevent potential attacks from unauthenticated users. (NEO-10173)
* Hardened permissions to prevent standard users from changing the instance configuration parameters such as application access URLs, LDAP settings, etc. (NEO-10171)
* Fixed an issue which could reveal sensitive information via stack traces. Error details are now logged in the back end to a location unaccessible from the external network. (NEO-10176)
* Hardened permissions to prevent standard users from viewing an administrator's uploaded documents and/or exported packages. (NEO-10170)

**Improvements**

* **LINE channel - architecture enhancement**: As with all other channels in Adobe Campaign, the LINE channel is now supported across all deployment types: hosted, hybrid, and on-premise. 
* **Sequence auto-generation**: The ID generation mechanism has been enhanced to increase the lifespan of Campaign instances with large volumes of objects. For more information, refer to this [technote](https://helpx.adobe.com/campaign/kb/sequence_auto_generation.html).

**Other changes**

* A new mode is available for package import using command line, allowing circular dependencies (not recommended for large packages). See the 'Technical evolutions' section for more information. (NEO-8979) 
* Improved performance for large amount of data loading in Teradata and fixed an issue which prevented from displaying the right value of data processed in the log. (NEO-10429)
* Importing audiences from Audience Manager now works with split files. Previously, only the last file of the segment was imported by the importSharedAudience technical workflow. (NEO-10156)
* On Windows, the Campaign server default installation path has changed. When launching the 64-bit version setup, the default installation path is now: **C:\Program Files\Adobe\Adobe Campaign Classic v7** instead of **C:\Program Files (x86)\Adobe\Adobe Campaign Classic v7**
* The default MX rules have been enhanced to include more domains and optimize throughput.
* Enforced access restrictions on the deployment wizard SOAP call (xtk:serverOptions#SaveOptions).
* The weka.jar obsolete library has been removed and the OpenSSL library has been updated for security optimization.
* Improved the billing technical workflow to secure instances performances.
* The ability for administrators to set or reset the password of any operator has been restored. To do this, right-click on an operator, select **[!UICONTROL Actions]** > **[!UICONTROL Reset password]** and set the operator's new password. We recommend that operators change their password when they first reconnect. For more information, refer to the [detailed documentation](../../production/using/lost-password.md).
* To support the new multitenancy feature in Adobe Target, a new “at_property” parameter can now be added to URLs when configuring options and external accounts for the integration with Target. The value to use for this parameter can be found in Adobe Target and will be used by Campaign when performing calls to Target. For more information, refer to the [detailed documentation](../../integrations/using/inserting-a-dynamic-image.md).
* You can now specify a default landing page to open when clicking on an image served by Adobe Target. Previously, clicking that image was leading to the default image set when creating the email instead. For more information, refer to the [detailed documentation](../../integrations/using/inserting-a-dynamic-image.md).
* Added **Enable SMPP traces** checkbox in the external account to force traces output. For more information, refer to the [detailed documentation](../../delivery/using/sms-channel.md#creating-an-smpp-external-account).

**Technical evolutions**

queryDef

queryDef has been modified regarding the "orderBy" clause. Before the change, the primary key of the queried table would implicitly be added to the "orderBy" clauses. On some database engines (postgresql at least), it prevents the use of indexes (all fields of the orderBy clause must be covered by the same index). If you were dependent of this behavior, you will have to explicitly add the primary key in your "orderBy" clause.

For example, if you have the following query:

```
<queryDef operation="select" schema="xtk:job" startPath="/" xtkschema="xtk:queryDef">
  <select>
     <node expr="@id"/>
   </select>
   <orderBy>
     <node expr="@logDate"/>
   </orderBy>
</queryDef>`
```

It would implicitly be handed as (before the 18.4 changes):

```
<queryDef operation="select" schema="xtk:job" startPath="/" xtkschema="xtk:queryDef">
  <select>
     <node expr="@id"/>
   </select>
   <orderBy>
      <node expr="@logDate"/>
      <node expr="@id"/> <!-- implicitely added before 18.4, you can add it manually on your query, if you relied on this implicit order clauses --!>
   </orderBy>
</queryDef>
```

urlEncode function

The 'urlEncode' JavaScript function was not working properly for non ASCII characters. It has been corrected and it should now work with all Unicode characters (including Japanese characters). If you were relying on the 'urlEncode' behavior for non ASCII character, you will have to adapt your code.

Package import new mode

A new mode is available for package import using command line, allowing circular dependencies (not recommended for large packages). The existing functionality is kept. For such packages with circular dependencies, a new flag **-usejs** has been added to the command line package import. When executed, it will use the JSEngine like when the package import is performed from the interface.

```
nlserver package -instance:fresh -import:sup-packInstallTest.xml -verbose -usejs
```
