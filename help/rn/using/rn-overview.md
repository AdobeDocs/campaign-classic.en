# Get started with upgrades{#rn-overview}

Adobe Campaign is regularly updated. On average, two or three minor versions are released every year with new features, improvements and fixes. In addition, we periodically release builds with cumulative fixes only. 

This regular frequence of updates aims at getting the latest and greatest in your hands, keeping your environment fully secure and improving your experience with our product.

This is the reason why we believe it is critical that you run the most recent version of Adobe Campaign. It also allows us to help you much more efficiently in case you run into issues. Identifying, reproducing and fixing an issue on an old build typically takes more time, not to mention that some issues you may encounter may very well have already been fixed in a recent build.

## Release statuses{#rn-statuses}

Starting Campaign Classic 19.2, a status is associated to each build. You'll find below the list of statuses and how to interpret them.

<table> 
 <tbody> 
  <tr> 
   <td><img src="assets/do-not-localize/green3.png"/><strong>General Availability</strong></td>
   <td><img src="assets/do-not-localize/blue3.png"/><strong>Release Candidate</strong></td> 
   <td><img src="assets/do-not-localize/orange3.png"/><strong>No longer available</strong></td> 
   <td><img src="assets/do-not-localize/red3.png"/><strong>Deprecated</strong></td> 
  </tr> 
   <tr> 
   <td>Latest stable build available. Build validated in production.<br>&nbsp;</td>
   <td>Build validated by Adobe. Waiting for production proofing.<br>&nbsp;</td>
   <td>Newer build available with bug fixes. Update is required.<br>&nbsp;</td>
   <td>Contains known regressions. Update is mandatory.<br>&nbsp;</td>
  </tr> 
 </tbody> 
</table>

The **last stable build** is 20.1.4 (build 9125). Click [here](../../rn/using/release--20-1.md)

## Process to upgrade{#process-upgrade}

As a hosted customer (Managed Service or Hybrid), you need to reach out to the Customer Care team to have your environment upgraded.

As a Gold Standard user, you will automatically benefit from the Gold Standard upgrade with the latest stable version without any action. [Learn more](https://helpx.adobe.com/campaign/kb/gold-standard.html) 

As an on-premise user, you can perform the upgrade. To do this, you need to download the latest stable build and upgrade all your environments. Learn more on the [upgrade process](https://helpx.adobe.com/campaign/kb/acc-build-upgrade.html), and consult the [build upgrade FAQ](https://helpx.adobe.com/campaign/kb/build-upgrade-faq.html).

## Recommandations{#recommandations}

To ensure a stable configuration, we recommend that you install the same stable build on all servers that are running on the same client configuration.
