## Release cycle

Adobe Campaign is regularly updated. This regular frequency of updates aims at getting the latest and greatest in your hands, keeping your environment secure and improving your experience with our product.

This is the reason why we believe it is critical that you **run the most recent stable version** of Adobe Campaign. It will also ensure that you get a better support experience as identifying, reproducing and fixing an issue on a recent build is usually much faster. Also, many issues you may encounter have already been fixed in most recent builds.

As a hosted customer, you automatically benefit from the upgrade with the latest stable version without any action. Learn more in the [Yearly Upgrade section](#yearly-upgrade). If you migrate from an old build, Adobe recommends that you upgrade to this version first.

## Recommendations{#recommendations}

To ensure a stable configuration, we recommend that you install **the same stable build** on all servers that are running on the same client configuration.

In addition, the client console must be on the same build as the server instance.

To keep your implementation up-to-date, make sure to read out the [Deprecated and removed features](../../rn/using/deprecated-features.md) and [Compatibility matrix](../../rn/using/compatibility-matrix.md) pages with each new release.

## Process to upgrade{#process-upgrade}

As a hosted customer (Managed Service or Hybrid), you need to reach out to the Customer Care team to have your environment upgraded.

As an on-premise user, you can perform the upgrade. To do this, you need to [download the latest stable build](https://experience.adobe.com/#/downloads/content/software-distribution/en/campaign.html) and upgrade all your environments. Learn more on the [upgrade process](../../production/using/build-upgrade.md), and consult the [build upgrade FAQ](../../platform/using/faq-build-upgrade.md).

## Yearly upgrade {#yearly-upgrade}

Adobe and Adobe Campaign is committed to providing you with the best experience and value through our software solution(s). The organization is committed to ensuring that you have access to the most current versions of related technology that our solutions leverage to perform its tasks.

Adobe Campaign Classic, specifically, uses a range of technology to deliver value. This combination of technologies requires you to upgrade your Campaign Classic instance(s) on a regular basis, to ensure the most up-to-date versions are being used to deliver superior security, stability, and performance.

As a hosted user, you will automatically benefit from the upgrade with the latest stable build without any action. Learn more in the FAQs below.

### Why does my organization need this upgrade?

As a hosted customer, if your account has been identified as needing to upgrade one or more of the technologies related to Campaign Classic, as well as updating the current build and/or version, you will be notified directly in by Adobe.

As an on-premise or hybrid customer running on an older version, Adobe encourages you to move to the latest stable build.

This will ensure that your account is secure from vulnerabilities, as well as leveraging updated performance technology. This upgrade will also position your account for easier, regular upgrades going forward that will require less manual work and intervention.

### What is the process and timeline for this upgrade?

The Adobe team will lead and guide your organization through this journey.

We have organized a team of dedicated Customer Care Reps, Product Managers, Engineers and TechOps Specialists, and Product Consultants to assist and ensure the experience is smooth.

We are committed to making sure you have the relevant project and contact information.
