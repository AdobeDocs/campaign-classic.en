# Release updates{#rn-overview}



Adobe Campaign Classic periodically releases product updates which bring new capabilities, bug fixes, and improve performance, security, and usability. These updates are released as **product builds**. Detailed information about each new build is available in the [Release notes](latest-release.md).

## Release statuses{#rn-statuses}

Every new build comes with a status which is identified by a color in the [Release notes](latest-release.md). 

![](assets/do-not-localize/green3.png) **General Availability** (GA) - Latest stable build, validated in production, and recommended by Adobe. 

![](assets/do-not-localize/limited3.png) **Limited Availability** (LA) - On-demand deployment only.

![](assets/do-not-localize/blue3.png) **Release Candidate** (RC) - Latest build with new capabilities.

![](assets/do-not-localize/orange3.png) **No longer available** - No deployment. No bug fix. Update to a newer build is recommended.

![](assets/do-not-localize/red3.png) **Deprecated** - No deployment. No bug fix. Existing implementations must be upgraded.

## Release cycle{#rn-cycle}

Adobe Campaign is regularly updated. This regular frequency of updates aims at getting the latest and greatest in your hands, keeping your environment secure and improving your experience with our product.

This is the reason why it is critical that you **run the most recent stable build** of Adobe Campaign. It also ensures that you get a better support experience as identifying, reproducing and fixing an issue on a recent build is usually much faster. Also, many issues you may encounter have already been fixed in most recent builds.

As a hosted customer, you automatically benefit from the upgrade with the latest stable build without any action. Learn more in the [Yearly Upgrade section](#yearly-upgrade). If you migrate from an old build, Adobe recommends that you upgrade to this build first.

## Recommendations{#recommendations}

To ensure a stable configuration, Adobe recommends that you install **the same build** on all servers that are running on the same client configuration.

In addition, except mentioned otherwise in the [Release notes](latest-release.md), the client console must be on **the same build** as the server instance.

To keep your implementation up-to-date, make sure to read out the [Deprecated and removed features](../../rn/using/deprecated-features.md) and [Compatibility matrix](../../rn/using/compatibility-matrix.md) pages with each new release.

## Process to upgrade{#process-upgrade}

As a hosted, Managed Services or Hybrid customer, reach out to Adobe Customer Care to have your environment upgraded.

As an on-premise customer, you can perform the upgrade. To do this, [download the latest stable build (GA)](https://experience.adobe.com/#/downloads/content/software-distribution/en/campaign.html) and upgrade all your environments. 

Learn more on the [upgrade process](../../production/using/build-upgrade.md), and in the [build upgrade FAQ](../../platform/using/faq-build-upgrade.md).

## Yearly upgrade {#yearly-upgrade}

Adobe is committed to providing you with the best experience and value through our software solutions. The organization is committed to ensuring that you have access to the most current versions of related technology that our solutions use to perform its tasks.

Adobe Campaign Classic, specifically, uses a range of technology to deliver value. This combination of technologies requires you to upgrade your Campaign Classic instance(s) regularly, to ensure the most up-to-date versions are being used to deliver superior security, stability, and performance.

As a hosted user, you automatically benefit from the upgrade with the latest GA build without any action. Learn more in the FAQs below.

### Why does my organization need this upgrade?

As a hosted customer, if your account has been identified as needing to upgrade one or more of the technologies related to Campaign Classic, and upgrading your infrastructure to the current build (for example from v7.2.1 to v7.3.3) and/or version (for example from v7 to v8), Adobe directly notifies you.

As an on-premise or hybrid customer running on an older build, Adobe encourages you to move to the latest stable build (GA).

This ensures that your account is secure from vulnerabilities, as well as using updated performance technology. This upgrade also positions your account for easier, regular upgrades going forward that requires less manual work and intervention.

### What is the process and timeline for this upgrade?

The Adobe team is here to lead and guide your organization through this journey.

A team of dedicated Customer Care Representativess, Product Managers, Engineers and TechOps Specialists, and Product Consultants is here to assist and ensure the experience is smooth.
