### Security enhancements {#release-7-3-5-security}


* With Campaign Classic v7.3.5, the authentication process has been improved and secured. Technical operators should now use Adobe Identity Management System (IMS) to connect to Campaign. Learn how to migrate your existing technical account(s) in [this technote](../../technotes/using/ims-migration.md).
  
* In addition, as part of the effort to reinforce security and authentication process, Adobe Campaign highly recommends to migrate end user authentication mode from the login/password native authentication to Adobe Identity Management System (IMS). Learn how to migrate your operators in [this technote](../../technotes/using/migrate-users-to-ims.md).

* Now, when a web form has the **Pending publication** status, it does not become automatically live. To prevent security issues, it must be published before it becomes **Online** and accessible through the web form URL in a web browser.
