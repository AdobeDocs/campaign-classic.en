**Security enhancements**

* Fixed a security issue that could result in vulnerabilities to Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attacks and denial of service (DoS) attacks. (NEO-11453)
* Content (tracking redirection, mirror pages, surveys, etc.) will now be served by Campaign with the X-Robots-Tag: nocache header. This prevents the indexation of this content by Internet search engines. (NEO-11101)
* Fixed an XTK injection issue in subscription API (nms:subscription:Unsubscribe and nms:subscription:Subscribe).
* Fixed an XTK injection issue in the unsubscription web application.
* Removed passwords that were insecurely displayed in some SMS logs.

**Improvements**

* Campaign Classic APIs are now available in a [dedicated page](https://docs.adobe.com/content/help/en/campaign-classic/technicalresources/api/index.html). If you were using the jsapi.chm file, you should now refer to the new online version.
* PostgreSQL 10, Debian 9 and Teradata 16.20 are now supported. Refer to the [Compatibility matrix](https://helpx.adobe.com/campaign/kb/compatibility-matrix.html).
* When creating an SFTP connection, you can now use proxy authentication. For more information, refer to the [detailed documentation](../../installation/using/configuring-campaign-server.md#proxy-connection-configuration) (NEO-9868)
* The **Date calculation formula** option is now available in the delivery properties when creating a single delivery using the direct mail delivery template. (NEO-9792)
* The domain name management has been improved for cookie tracking and web applications. See the 'Technical evolutions' section below for more information. 
* The import of Adobe Marketing Cloud shared assets in a delivery or landing page has been improved in terms of security and performance.
* A new checkbox is available in the Mobile channel external account to enable verbose SMPP traces in the log file, which makes this output directly accessible from the Adobe Campaign interface.
* In the broadlogs, there is now a distinction between the maximum number of connections and the maximum number of messages per hour. When the limits are reached, it is then possible to know why the throughput is limited. Previously, the same message (‘quota met’) applied to both cases.
* You can now specify an SQL script to execute when acquiring a connection from the pool. This script can be used to set the default schema. This script will be applied after query banding. (NEO-11256) 
* Campaign SDK no longer stores the User ID to comply with our PII regulations. Data is now stored as a hash.
* When importing a package export XML file, Campaign now supports the presence of BOM in the file, even if the encoding is explicitly declared in it.

**Technical evolutions**

Client and server upgrade

>[!CAUTION]
>
>If you have a server that has been updated to 18.10, you will have to use a 18.10 client in order to access your server. The 18.10 client will be able to connect to an older server version.

Domain name management

The domain name management has been improved for cookie tracking and web applications.

Now, all two-letter second-level domain names are supported by default (for example .aa.com). For more complex domain names (for example three-letter second-level domains such as .com.au), you need to add them in the **cookieDomains** option of the serverConf (under the redirection tag). Here is an example:

```
<redirection cookiedomain="http://toureiffel.paris">
```

Index enhancements

Indexes on NmsRecipient have been reworked. This should improve performance on queries that use this table. If you had done an extension of NmsRecipient, you may want to verify that you don't have indexes that duplicate the new indexes (to minimize space usage on the database server). (NEO-8228)

On PostgreSql when using a UTF-8 collation, it's now possible to create indexes that will optimize "LIKE 'string%'" (or "starts with") operations. If you perform other operations on the same column (order by or join for example), another standard index will be required. On the schema side, this will be done by adding indexOption="searchFromStart" on the index definition (it will create a varchar_pattern_ops index instead of a standard btree index). For example (on NmsRecipient):

```
<dbindex name="email2"> <!-- optimize order by/join (and startWith if not PostgreSql with an UTF-8 collation) operations -->
  <keyfield xpath="@email"/>
</dbindex>
<dbindex name="email3" indexOption="searchFromStart"><!-- optimize startsWith operation on PostgreSql when a UTF-8 collation is used; create no index in other cases-->
  <keyfield xpath="@email" />
</dbindex>
```

New indexes have been added to NmsRtEvent and NmsEventHisto (on the "Scheduled" column), this should improve display time on the corresponding form (NEO-11738).

These index changes may lead to an increase of the time required to perform the post-upgrade.

**Patches**

* Fixed an error that occasionally left the **Sending of indicators and campaign attributes** workflow in a Failed state (NEO-10820).

* Fixed an issue that prevented some users with specific time zone configurations to log in to Adobe Campaign. (NEO-10712)

* Fixed an issue that caused scheduled deliveries to fail when setting a frequency for the pressure rule, because the deliveries were constantly re-calculated after the first arbitration. (NEO-10016)
* Fixed an issue that caused the IIS webserver to crash during the Application Pool recycle process (in nlsrvmod.dll library). (NEO-10862)
