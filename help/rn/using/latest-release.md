**Improvements**

* Shared memory version has been increased from 18 to 50 characters. However we recommend that you do not use more than 40 characters for theÂ name of the instance added to the domain name. This evolution should be transparent for users. If you get an error, refer to the **Technical evolution** section below.

**Other changes**

* XXX

**Technical evolutions**

Regarding the shared memory version improvement, you should not have to do anything.

For on-premise customers, you may need to delete shared memory after the upgrade (see instructions on this [page](../configuration/additional-parameters.md#redirection-server-configuration)) ONLY if you encounter the following error:

```
SRV-810031 Bad version for the shared memory block 'NlServerContext6.0'. Current version is 106, expected version 107. Please restart all services (nlserver and web server)...
```

**Patches**
