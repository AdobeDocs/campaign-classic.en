# Control Panel - August 2019{#control-panel}

26 August 2019

## What's new? {#what-s-new-}

Weâ€™ve added new capabilities for Admin users to receive notifications before SSL certificates for their domains expire. For more information, refer to the [detailed documentation](https://helpx.adobe.com/campaign/kb/control-panel-subdomains-certificates.html).

Additionally, Admin users can now delete SSH keys that were added to access SFTP servers.

Please note that Control Panel is available for customers hosted on AWS only. No upgrades are required to access Control Panel.
