# Control Panel - September 2019{#control-panel}

16 September 2019

Weâ€™ve added new capabilities for Admin users to whitelist IP addresses to connect to Campaign Classic instances.
Additionally, Admin users can now view the list of instances and eligibility for build upgrades.

For more information, refer to the [dedicated documentation](https://helpx.adobe.com/campaign/kb/control-panel-instance-settings.html).

These updates will be available on September 16th. Please note that Control Panel is available for customers hosted on AWS only. No upgrades are required. Please make sure you are an Admin user to access it.
