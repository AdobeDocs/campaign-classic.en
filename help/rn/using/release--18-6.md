   <td> <p>When multiple Campaign users connect to the same FDA Teradata external account, you can now pass a query band (key/value pairs) specific to each user. Each time a Campaign user performs a query on the Teradata database, Adobe Campaign is now able to send meta data associated to the user. These data, which consist in a list of keys and values can then be used by Teradata administrators for audit purposes or to manage access rights, for example.</p><p>For more information, refer to the <a href="../../installation/using/external-accounts.md">detailed documentation</a>.</p> </td>

* Fixed a random issue causing the properties of a delivery to be wrongly overwritten. (NEO-11015)
* Fixed a syntax error when sorting enrichment activity results. (NEO-11394)
* Fixed an issue when using calculated fields in a **[!UICONTROL Survey answers]** workflow activity. (NEO-11382)
* Tomcat has been updated to prevent vulnerabilities exploitation. (NEO-11503)
* Fixed an error with LATIN1 encoding when using an FDA Connection to a PostgreSQL database. (NEO-11299)

* Fixed a postupgrade issue which prevented sending SMS from being sent when using an extended connector.
* Improved package import/export (log and region were added in the interface).

**Technical evolutions**

Query banding

A specific key (PROXYUSER or PROXYROLE) is used to associate a Teradata user or role to a Campaign user. A new permission has been added to use this proxy user/role. You need to add the GRANT CONNECT THROUGH access right to the database account (the one defined in the Teradata external account).

A new tab has been added in the Teradata external accounts. The **[!UICONTROL Query banding]** tab includes the following options:

* **[!UICONTROL Active]**: check this box to activate the feature.
* **[!UICONTROL Default]**: enter a default query banding that will be used if a user has no associated query banding. If there is no default query banding defined, the users who have no associated query banding will not be able to use Teradata.
* **[!UICONTROL Users]**: for each user, specify a query banding. You can add as many key/value pairs as you need. For example: ‘priority=1;workload=high;’

For more information on query banding, refer to these articles:

**Security enhancements**

decryptString

The **decryptString** function is deprecated. Refer to the [Deprecated and Removed Features](https://helpx.adobe.com/campaign/kb/deprecated-and-removed-features.html) article.

For new customers, this function is now only used to decrypt the recipient's crypted ID in landing pages. To decrypt passwords stored in an external account, use the new **decryptPassword** function.

For existing customers, the behavior of this function is not changed but we recommend that you use **decryptPassword** instead of **decryptString**. The **XtkSecurity_Unsafe_DecryptString** compatibility option is added by the postupgrade and activated by default, allowing you to keep using the function. If you want to deactivate **decryptString**, deactivate the option.

decryptPassword

The **decryptPassword** function has been added. It allows you to decrypt a password stored in an external account. Refer to the [JSAPI](https://helpx.adobe.com/campaign/kb/compatibility-matrix.html) documentation for more information.

File APIs

For new installations, folder access via file APIs is limited to the **var**, **sftp** and temporary folders of Adobe Campaign.

For existing customers, file APIs can no longer access the **conf** folder of Adobe Campaign. The **XtkSecurity_Disable_JSFileSandboxing** compatibility option is added by the postupgrade and activated by default, allowing you to keep accessing the other folders. If you want to limit the access to the **var**, **sftp** and temporary folders of Adobe Campaign, deactivate the option.

**Patch**

* Fixed an issue that could affect SMS transactional message performance. (NEO-9812)
