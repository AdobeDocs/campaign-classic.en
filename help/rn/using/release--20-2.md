**Security enhancements**

* Improved security on tracking links in email is enabled by default for all customers. An additional, enhanced security feature is available which can be enabled by reaching out to Customer Care. More details on the feature and steps for non-hosted customers to enable it can be found in the [Security and Privacy checklist](https://helpx.adobe.com/campaign/kb/acc-security.html). (NEO-24232)

* To optimize security, the MD5 hashing algorithm used to generate file names has been reinforced with sha256 for public file upload. (NEO-17044)

* To reinforce security against XSS attacks, client-side scripts are disabled when executing a mirror page. (NEO-17987)

* Fixed an issue which prevented the **Privacy Request Cleanup** technical workflow from deleting reconciliation data. (NEO-25168, NEO-21004)

* Fixed an issue with the **File Transfer** activity which prevented SFTP key based authentication from working on Debian 9. (NEO-23183)

**Compatibility enhancements**

The following systems are now supported with Campaign:
* Operating systems: Debian 10
* RDBMS: Oracle 18c and Oracle 19c
* FDA: Azure Synapse Analytics

Learn more in [Campaign Compatibility matrix](https://helpx.adobe.com/campaign/kb/compatibility-matrix.html).

**Improvements**

* Transactional messaging has been improved for a better user experience. You can now unpublish a transactional message template, which deletes it from the execution instances. [Learn more](../../message-center/using/template-unpublication.md).

* New options are available to set limitations when sending emails that include images or attachments. These guardrails can avoid performance issues, which is particularly useful with transactional messaging. [Read more](../../installation/using/configuring-campaign-options.md#delivery)

* The new **Prepare the delivery parts in the database** option enables to perform delivery preparation directly within the database, which can significantly accelerate the analysis. This option is only available for specific configurations. [Learn more](../../delivery/using/steps-validating-the-delivery.md#improving-delivery-analysis). (NEO-23886)

* The performance of the [CRM Connector activity](../../workflow/using/crm-connector.md) for Microsoft Dynamics has been improved. (NEO-13303, NEO-12710)

* Shared memory version has been increased.

  >[!WARNING]
  >
  >This improvement requires an additional step after performing the upgrade. Refer to the **Technical evolutions** section below.

* The cleanup workflow has been enhanced. Orphaned worktables of all deleted workflows are now also deleted automatically by the cleanup workflow. [Learn more](../../production/using/database-cleanup-workflow.md#cleanup-of-workflow-instances).

* Certificates for iOS mobile applications with the iOS HTTP2 connector are now validated before sending push notifications, thus preventing deliveries from failing because of expired certificates. 

* The management of HTTP proxy connections has been improved. [Learn more](../../installation/using/configuring-campaign-server.md#proxy-connection-configuration).

* New option in **[!UICONTROL Javascript Code]** and **[!UICONTROL Advanced Javascript Code]** workflow activities to stop execution after a limit. Default value is 1 hour. [Learn more](../../workflow/using/sql-code-and-javascript-code.md#javascript-code).

**Other changes**

* Legacy SMS connectors are now deprecated. Refer to the [Deprecated features page](../../rn/using/deprecated-features.md).

* You can no longer use your own Litmus account to provision and use Inbox rendering in Adobe Campaign. [Learn more](../../delivery/using/inbox-rendering.md).

* To better distinguish views from folders, the color of view names has been changed from dark blue to dark cyan. [Read more](../../platform/using/access-management.md#about-views)

* Campaign Classic can now be connected to Microsoft Dynamics CRM accounts hosted in the UK, India and Canada regions. This applies to  Office 365 and On premise (Dynamics 2015) deployment types.

* Campaign now performs a TLS verification to check that the hostname of the server matches the hostname in the provided certificate.

* The Delivery and tracking statistics table now displays one entry per delivery for the SMS channel, instead of one entry per delivery recipient.  

* Added an error message in the log file to warn users when the downloaded file is larger than the disk space.

* The following functions are now available for the Snowflake connector: MonthsAgo, DaysAgoInt, ToDateTime, YearsAgo.

**Technical evolutions**

This new build updates shared memory and requires additional steps to perform the upgrade. As a Campaign administrator, you need to remove memory segments. These steps are mandatory, as old segments will prevent nlserver/nlsrvmod from starting.

On Windows, a system restart is needed.

On Debian/CentOs, shared memory deletion is needed. Here are the steps:

Before the upgrade, you need to follow these steps:

1. Stop the apache2 (http2 on CentOS) service if it's running.
1. Stop the nlserver (nlserver6 for older builds) service if it's running.

After the upgrade:

1. Remove the shared memory using the **ipcrm** command, if the version is older than the current version.
1. Start the nlserver service if it was running.
1. Start the apache2 service if it was running.

Here are the command lines for Debian:

```
/etc/init.d/nlserver* stop
/etc/init.d/apache2 stop

for i in `ipcs -s | awk '/www-data/
{print $2}'`; do (ipcrm -s $i); done

for i in `ipcs -m | awk '/www-data/ {print $2}
'`; do (ipcrm shm $i); done

for i in `ipcs -m | awk '/neolane/
{print $2}'`; do (ipcrm shm $i); done

for i in `ipcs -s | awk '/neolane/ {print $2}
'`; do (ipcrm -s $i); done

/etc/init.d/apache2 restart
/etc/init.d/nlserver* start
```

An example for Linux is available on this [page](../../configuration/using/additional-parameters.md#redirection-server-configuration).
