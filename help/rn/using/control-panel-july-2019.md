# Control Panel - July 2019{#control-panel}

15 July 2019

## What's new? {#what-s-new-}

We've added new features to empower Admin users to take greater control of instance settings. New Control Panel capabilities include the ability to add URLs that Adobe Campaign connect to for data/file transfers.

For more information, refer to the [detailed documentation](https://helpx.adobe.com/campaign/kb/control-panel-instance-settings.html).

Please note that Control Panel is available for customers hosted on AWS only. No upgrades are required to access Control Panel.
