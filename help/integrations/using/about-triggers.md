# Work with Campaign and Experience Cloud Triggers{#about-adobe-experience-triggers}

![](../../assets/common.svg)

[!DNL Triggers] is an integration between Adobe Campaign and Adobe Analytics using the pipeline. The pipeline retrieves users' actions or triggers from your website. A cart abandonment is an example of trigger. Triggers are processed in Adobe Campaign to send emails in near real time.

[!DNL Triggers] run marketing actions within a short range of time following a userâ€™s action. The typical response time is less than one hour.

It allows for more agile integrations since the configuration is minimal and a third party is not involved.
It also supports high volumes of traffic without impacting the performance of marketing activities. As an example, the integration can process a million triggers per hour.

## [!DNL Triggers] architecture {#triggers-architecture}

The [!DNL pipelined] process is always running on the Adobe Campaign marketing server. It connects to the pipeline, retrieves the events, and processes them immediately.

The [!DNL pipelined] process logs in to the Experience Cloud using an authentication service and sends a private key. The authentication service returns a token. The token is used to authenticate when retrieving the events.

For more information on authentication, refer to this [page](../../integrations/using/configuring-adobe-io.md).
