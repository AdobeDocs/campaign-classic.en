# About Adobe Experience Manager{#about-adobe-experience-manager}

Integration between Adobe Campaign and Adobe Experience Manager allows you to manage the content of your email deliveries as well as your forms directly in Adobe Experience Manager.

You can also directly insert assets from your AEM Assets library while editing an email or a landing page in Adobe Campaign. This functionality is detailed in the [Assets](../../integrations/using/sharing-assets-with-adobe-experience-cloud.md) chapter.

This means that you can make the most of both AEM's content editing functionalities as well as Adobe Campaign's delivery capacities.

**Prerequisites**

You must have the following elements:

* An Adobe Experience Manager **authoring** instance.
* An Adobe Experience Manager **publishing** instance.
* An Adobe Campaign instance.

Adobe Campaign is compatible with Adobe Experience Manager 6.1, 6.2, 6.3, 6.4 and 6.5. The following sections present an overview of the integration.
