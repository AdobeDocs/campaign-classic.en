>[!NOTE]

>To be able to proceed further, make sure that IMS is enabled on your system. Consult the section about [IMS](../../integrations/using/about-adobe-id.md).

Once IMS is enabled, you can request provisioning of the People core service/Audience Manager integration with Campaign. To do that, send an email to [Digital-Request@adobe.com](mailto:Digital-Request@adobe.com) with the following information:

<table>

  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td> <strong>IMS Organization ID</strong><br /> </td> 
   <td> Your IMS Organization ID. <br> You can find your IMS Organization ID on the Experience Cloud, in the Administration menu. It is also provided when you first connect to the Adobe Experience Cloud. </td>
