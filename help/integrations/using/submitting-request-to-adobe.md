>[!NOTE]
>
>To be able to proceed further, make sure that IMS is enabled on your system. Consult the section about [IMS](../../integrations/using/about-adobe-id.md).

Once IMS is enabled, you can request provisioning of the People core service/Audience Manager integration with Campaign. To do that, send an email to [Digital-Request@adobe.com](mailto:Digital-Request@adobe.com) with the following information:

<table> 
 <tbody> 
  <tr> 
   <td> <strong>Request Type:</strong><br /> </td> 
   <td> Configure AAM/People core service-Campaign Integration </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr>

   <td> Your organization name </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td> <strong>IMS Organization ID</strong><br /> </td> 
   <td> Your IMS Organization ID. <br> You can find your IMS Organization ID on the Experience Cloud, in the Administration menu. It is also provided when you first connect to the Adobe Experience Cloud. </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td> <strong>Environment:</strong><br /> </td> 
   <td> Example: Production </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td> <strong>AAM or People Service</strong><br /> </td>
