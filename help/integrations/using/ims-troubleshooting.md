# IMS troubleshooting{#ims-troubleshooting}


The following troubleshooting tips will help **on-premise** and **hybrid** customers solve the most common problems happening when using the IMS integration. For **hosted** customers, please contact Adobe.

**External Account**

There should only be **one** external account with the following settings:

* **Internal Name**: Adobe_Marketing_Cloud
* **Type**: Adobe Marketing Cloud

Delete any duplicate external account that have same the same settings.

**Product Context**

If the external account has a **Product Context** field, check that its value is set to: **dma_campaign_classic**

Make sure your product context is the same for Campaign and Experience Cloud.

For example, if the **Product Context** does not appear, the default product context should be **dma_campaign** in both Campaign and Experience Cloud. If the **Product Context** field appears, the default product context should be **dma_campaign_classic** in both Campaign and Experience Cloud.

**[!UICONTROL IMS Server URL]**

In the Campaign **Adobe Marketing Cloud** external account, check that the **[!UICONTROL IMS Server URL]** is either `adobeid-na1.services.adobe.com` or `ims-na1.adobelogin.com`. Make sure both stage and production instances point to the same IMS production end point.

**Association Mask**

* Check that the user trying to login is part of an operator group in the Enterprise Dashboard.
* Check that the **[!UICONTROL Association Mask]** is a prefix of the user's operator group name in the Enterprise Dashboard.
* Make sure there are no white spaces and spelling mistakes. 
* Check that the names of the operator groups in Campaign have not been changed and respect the following syntax:

```
<Association Mask> + <Operator Group Name in Campaign> = Complete name of the operator group in Enterprise Dashboard
```

**Scope**

Scopes defined in the Campaign external account must be a subset of those provisioned by IMS.

**Callback URL**

The **Callback URL** should be added to the allowlist and start with "https://". Check that the **Callback URL** is linked to the corresponding instance. For example, the production instance should redirect to the production URL.

**Client ID and secret**

The client ID matches between the Campaign external account and the one provisioned by IMS.

Check that the client secret entered is correct.

**Restart the server**

Restart the server if any changes are made to the above settings in the Campaign external account

**Common types of errors and possible solutions**

* User is redirected to adobe.com page:

  There is a problem with the **[!UICONTROL Callback URL]**. Refer to the previous steps to check the **[!UICONTROL Callback URL]** configuration.

* Message "Login does not have any right matching the expression":

  Refer to the previous steps to check the **[!UICONTROL Association Mask]** and operator groups configuration.

* The user is unable to access the Adobe ID login page:

  Refer to the previous steps to check the scope configuration.
