# About Adobe ID{#about-adobe-id}

Adobe Identity Management System (IMS) helps admins create and manage user's access to applications and services. For more information on the different types of Adobe IDs, refer to [this page](https://helpx.adobe.com/enterprise/using/identity.html).

Campaign users can connect to the Adobe Campaign console using their Adobe ID. This integration provides the following advantages:

* The same ID can be used for all Experience Cloud solutions.
* The connection is memorized when using Adobe Campaign with different integrations.
* Securer password management policy.
* Use of Federated ID accounts (external ID provider).


>[!IMPORTANT]

>If you are connecting to Campaign through Adobe Identity Service (IMS), you need to upgrade to the latest build to be able to connect to Campaign after **June 30, 2021**. This upgrade is mandatory for both Campaign server and client console. Depending on your current version, you must upgrade to one of the following releases:
