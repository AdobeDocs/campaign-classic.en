# About Adobe ID{#about-adobe-id}

Campaign users can connect to the Adobe Campaign console using their Adobe ID. This integration provides the following advantages:

* The same ID can be used for all Experience Cloud solutions.
* The connection is memorized when using Adobe Campaign with different integrations.
* Securer password management policy.
* Use of Federated ID accounts (external ID provider).

For more information on the different types of Adobe IDs, please consult: [https://helpx.adobe.com/en/enterprise/help/identity.md](https://helpx.adobe.com/en/enterprise/help/identity.md)
