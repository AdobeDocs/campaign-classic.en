# About Adobe ID{#about-adobe-id}

Campaign users can connect to the Adobe Campaign console using their Adobe ID. This integration provides the following advantages:

* The same ID can be used for all Experience Cloud solutions.
* The connection is memorized when using Adobe Campaign with different integrations.
* Securer password management policy.
* Use of Federated ID accounts (external ID provider).

Adobe IMS (Identity Management System) helps admins create and manage user's access to applications and services. For more information on the different types of Adobe IDs, refer to [this page](https://helpx.adobe.com/enterprise/using/identity.html).

>[!IMPORTANT]

>Adobe IMS implementation is strictly reserved to the Adobe technical administrators. Contact your Adobe executive to start the implementation process.
