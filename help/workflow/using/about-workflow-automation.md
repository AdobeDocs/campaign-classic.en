# Automate with workflows {#gs-workflows}

Adobe Campaign's workflows enable your team to streamline and automate end-to-end business processes across the platform. With an intuitive graphical interface, you can design and manage workflows that coordinate tasks such as data segmentation, campaign execution, file handling, and even user approvals â€” all in one place.

For instance, you can automate a process to retrieve a file from a remote server, extract its contents, and seamlessly load the data into Adobe Campaign server - reducing manual effort and increasing operational efficiency. The workflow engine ensures every step is executed reliably and tracked for visibility and control.

Adobe Campaign uses workflows to:

* Carry out targeting campaigns. [Learn more](building-a-workflow.md#implementation-steps-)
* Build campaigns: for each campaign, the **[!UICONTROL Workflow]** tab lets you build the target and create the deliveries. [Learn more](building-a-workflow.md#campaign-workflows)
* Perform technical processes: cleanup, collecting tracking information or provisional calculations. [Learn more](building-a-workflow.md#technical-workflows)

A workflow can mean both a process definition (the workflow model, which is a representation of what is supposed to happen) and an instance of this process (a workflow instance, which is a representation of what is actually happening).

The workflow template describes the various tasks to be performed and how they are linked together. The task templates are called activities and are represented by icons. They are linked together by transitions.

![](assets/example1.png)

Each workflow contains:

* **[!UICONTROL Activities]**

  An activity describes a task template. The various activities available are represented on the diagram by icons. Each type has common properties and specific properties. For example, while all activities have a name and label, only the **[!UICONTROL Approval]** activity has an assignment.

  In a workflow diagram, a given activity can produce multiple tasks, in particular when there is a loop or recurrent (periodic) actions.

  All workflow activities are listed in [this section](about-activities.md), including use cases and samples.

* **[!UICONTROL Transitions]**

  Transitions enable you to link activities and to define their sequence. A transition links a source activity to a destination activity. There are several sorts of transitions, which depend on the source activity. Some transitions have additional parameters such as a duration, a condition or a filter.

  A transition which is not linked to a destination activity is colored orange and the arrow head is shown as a diamond.

  >[!NOTE]
  >
  >A workflow containing unterminated transitions can still be executed: a warning message will be generated and the workflow will pause once it reaches the transition but it will not generate an error. It is thus possible to start a workflow without it being finished and to add to it as you go along.

  For more information about how to build a workflow, refer to [this section](building-a-workflow.md).

* **[!UICONTROL Worktables]**

  The worktable contains all the information carried by the transition. Each workflow uses several worktables. The data conveyed in these tables can be accelerated and used throughout the workflow's life cycle, as long as it is not purged. Indeed, unneeded tables are purged each time the workflow is passivated, and possibly during the execution of the largest workflows to avoid overloading the server.

  Learn more on workflow data and tables in [this section](how-to-use-workflow-data.md).
