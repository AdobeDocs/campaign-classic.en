# Microsoft CRM, Salesforce, Oracle CRM On Demand{#microsoft-crm-salesforce-oracle-crm-on-demand}

These three activities are pre-configured CRM connectors. They are similar to the CRM connector presented in the [CRM Connector](../../workflow/using/crm-connector.md) section.

Nevertheless, you have more specific options. In particular, you can choose the type of campaign to carry out for the synchronization:

* **Insert or update**: creates an entry if it doesn't exist or updates it if it already exists.
* **Insert**: creates an entry if it doesn't exist.
* **Update**: updates an entry if it already exists.
