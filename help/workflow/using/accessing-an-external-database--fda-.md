# Accessing an external database (FDA){#accessing-an-external-database-fda}

Adobe Campaign provides the Federated Data Access (FDA) option in order to process information stored in one or more external databases: you can access external data without changing the structure of Adobe Campaign data.

Multiple activities allow you to interact with data from an external database:

* Query
* Split
* Enrichment
* Data loading

Use of the FDA option depends on your Adobe Campaign license. Configuring this option as well as the best practices and limitations linked to using it are detailed in this [section](../../installation/using/about-fda.md).
