This aggregate captures the following dimensions: Channel, Delivery, Marketing Offer and Date.<br /> The <strong>Offer proposition</strong> cube is then used to generate reports based on offers. You can learn more about cubes in <a href="../../reporting/using/about-cubes.md">this section</a>.<br /> </td>
