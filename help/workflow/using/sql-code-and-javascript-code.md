# SQL code and JavaScript code{#sql-code-and-javascript-code}

## SQL code {#sql-code}

An **[!UICONTROL SQL code]** activity executes an SQL script. The script is a JST template.

* **[!UICONTROL Script]**

  The central area of the editor contains the script to be executed. This script is a JST template and can therefore be configured according to the workflow context.

* **[!UICONTROL Processing errors]**

  Refer to [Processing errors](monitoring-workflow-execution.md#processing-errors).

## JavaScript code and Advanced JavaScript code {#javascript-code}

**[!UICONTROL JavaScript code]** and **[!UICONTROL Advanced JavaScript code]** activities execute a JavaScript script in the context of a workflow. For more on scripting, refer to these sections:

* [JavaScript scripts and templates](javascript-scripts-and-templates.md)
* [Examples of JavaScript code in workflows](javascript-in-workflows.md)

### Execution delay {#exec-delay}

Starting 20.2 release, an execution delay has been added to the **[!UICONTROL JavaScript code]** and **[!UICONTROL Advanced JavaScript code]** activities. By default, the execution phase cannot exceed 1 hour. After this delay, the process will be aborted with an error message and the activity execution will fail.

You can change this delay in the **[!UICONTROL Stop execution after]** field available in these activities.

To ignore this limit, you need to set the value to **0**.

### JavaScript code {#js-code-desc}

![](assets/javascript_code.png)

* **[!UICONTROL Script]**: The central area of the editor contains the script to be executed.

* **[!UICONTROL Process errors]**: Refer to [Processing errors](monitoring-workflow-execution.md#processing-errors).

### Advanced JavaScript code {#adv-js-code-desc}

![](assets/advanced_javascript_code.png)

* **[!UICONTROL First call]**: The first zone of the editor contains the script to execute during the first call.
* **[!UICONTROL Next calls]**: The second zone of the editor contains the script to execute during the next calls.
* **[!UICONTROL Transitions]**: You can define several activity output transitions.
* **[!UICONTROL Schedule]**: The **[!UICONTROL Schedule]** tab lets you schedule when to trigger the activity.

Advanced JavaScript is a persistent task and is periodically recalled if it has not been marked as completed. To terminate the task and prevent future recalls, you must use the **task.setCompleted()** method in the **[!UICONTROL Next calls]** section:

```
task.postEvent(task.transitionByName("ok")); // to transition to Ok branch
task.setCompleted();

return 0;
```
