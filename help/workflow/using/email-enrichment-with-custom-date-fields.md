# Email enrichment with custom date fields{#email-enrichment-with-custom-date-fields}



In this example, we want to send an email with custom data fields to recipients who will celebrate their birthdays this month. The email will include a coupon valid one week before and after their birthdays.

We need to target recipients from a list who will celebrate their birthdays this month with a **[!UICONTROL Split]** activity. Then, using the **[!UICONTROL Enrichment]** activity, the custom data field will act as validity dates in the email for the customer's special offer.

To create this example, apply the following steps:

1. In the **[!UICONTROL Targeting and workflows]** tab of your campaign, drag and drop a **[!UICONTROL Read list]** activity to target your list of recipients.
1. The list to be processed can be specified explicitly, computed by a script or localized dynamically, according to options selected and parameters defined here.

1. Add a **[!UICONTROL Split]** activity to differentiate recipients who will celebrate their birthdays this month from other recipients.
1. To split your list, in the **[!UICONTROL Filtering of selected records]** category, select **[!UICONTROL Add a filtering condition on the inbound population]**. Then, click **[!UICONTROL Edit]**.

1. Select **[!UICONTROL Filtering conditions]** then click the **[!UICONTROL Edit expression]** button to filter the month of the recipient's birthday.

1. Click **[!UICONTROL Advanced Selection]** then **[!UICONTROL Edit the formula using an expression]** and add the following expression: Month(@birthDate).
1. In the **[!UICONTROL Operator]** column, select the **[!UICONTROL equal to]**.
1. Further filter your condition, by adding the **[!UICONTROL Value]** month of the current date: Month(GetDate()).

   This will query recipients whose birthday's month corresponds to the current month.

1. Click **[!UICONTROL Finish]**. Then, in the **[!UICONTROL General]** tab of your **[!UICONTROL Split]** activity, click the **[!UICONTROL Generate complement]** in the **[!UICONTROL Results]** category.

   With the **[!UICONTROL Complement]** result, you can add a delivery activity or update a list. Here, we just added an **[!UICONTROL End]** activity.

You now need to configure your **[!UICONTROL Enrichment]** activity:

1. Add an **[!UICONTROL Enrichment]** activity after your subset to add your custom date fields.

1. Open your **[!UICONTROL Enrichment]** activity. In the **[!UICONTROL Complementary information]** category, click **[!UICONTROL Add data]**.

1. Select **[!UICONTROL Data linked to the filtering dimension]** then **[!UICONTROL Data of the filtering dimension]**.
1. Click the **[!UICONTROL Add]** button. 

   ![](assets/uc_enrichment_9.png)

1. Add a **[!UICONTROL Label]**. Then, in the **[!UICONTROL Expression]** column, click **[!UICONTROL Edit expression]**.

   ![](assets/uc_enrichment_10.png)

1. First, we need to target the week before the birthdate as the **Validity start date** with the following **[!UICONTROL Expression]**: `SubDays([target/@birthDate], 7)`.

   ![](assets/uc_enrichment_11.png)

1. Then, to create the custom date field **Validity end date** which will target the week after the birthdate, you need to add the **[!UICONTROL Expression]**: `AddDays([target/@birthDate], 7)`.

   You can add a label to your expression.

   ![](assets/uc_enrichment_12.png)

1. Click **[!UICONTROL Ok]**. Your enrichment is now ready.

After your **[!UICONTROL Enrichment]** activity, you can add a delivery. In this case, we added an email delivery to send recipients a special offer with validity dates to customers celebrating their birthdays this month.

1. Drag and drop an **[!UICONTROL Email delivery]** activity after your **[!UICONTROL Enrichment]** activity.

   ![](assets/uc_enrichment_15.png)

1. Double-click your **[!UICONTROL Email delivery]** activity to start personalizing your delivery.
1. Add a **[!UICONTROL Label]** to your delivery and click **[!UICONTROL Continue]**.
1. Click **[!UICONTROL Save]** to create your email delivery.
1. Check in the **[!UICONTROL Approval]** tab of the email delivery **[!UICONTROL Properties]** that the **[!UICONTROL Confirm delivery before sending option]** is checked.

   Then, start your workflow to enrich your outbound transition with the targeted information.

You can now start designing your email delivery with the custom date fields created in the **[!UICONTROL Enrichment]** activity.

1. Double-click your **[!UICONTROL Email delivery]** activity.
1. Add your target extensions to your email. It should be inside the following expression in order to configure the format of your validity dates:

   ```
   <%=
           formatDate(targetData.alias of your expression,"%2D.%2M")  %>
   ```

1. Click ![](assets/uc_enrichment_16.png) . Select **[!UICONTROL Target extension]** then the previously created custom validity dates with the **[!UICONTROL Enrichment]** activity to add your extension to the formatDate expression.
