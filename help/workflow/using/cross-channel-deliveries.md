Select the template on which you want to base your delivery and define its content.

You can specify a target for your delivery upstream of the workflow using the different targeting activities.

In the example below, we will create a workflow to send an email or an SMS for push notification subscribers then a push notification one week later. To do this:

1. Create a campaign.
1. In the **[!UICONTROL Targeting and workflows]** tab of your campaign, add a **[!UICONTROL Query]** to your workflow.
1. Configure your query. For example, here we select the recipients who are subscribed to push notifications as the target dimension.

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >For the push notifications, use the **subscriber applications** target dimension.
