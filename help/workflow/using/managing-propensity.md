# Managing propensity{#managing-propensity}

You can choose to force the execution of a workflow or workflow activity on a specific machine. To do this, you must define one or more propensities at the level of the workflow or the concerned activity.

High availability workflow configuration is detailed in this [section](../../installation/using/configuring-campaign-server.md#high-availability-workflows-and-affinities).
