* **Fork**: allow you to activate all outbound transitions. Refer to the [Fork](../../workflow/using/fork.md) section.
* **Appointment**: lets you wait for several tasks started at the same time to be completed before proceeding. Refer to the [Fork](../../workflow/using/fork.md) section.
* **Scheduler**: lets you define a workflow execution schedule. Refer to [Scheduler](../../workflow/using/scheduler.md).
* **Test**: enables a transition based on a test result. Refer to [Test](../../workflow/using/test.md).
* **Wait**: enables the outbound transition after a given time limit. Refer to [Wait](../../workflow/using/wait.md).
* **Time constraint**: lets you pause a task for a set period. Refer to [Time constraint](../../workflow/using/time-constraint.md).
* **Sub-workflow**: lets you execute another workflow. Refer to [Sub-workflow](../../workflow/using/sub-workflow.md).
* **Jumps**: lets you implement transitions without links. Refer to [Jump (start point and end point)](../../workflow/using/jump--start-point-and-end-point-.md).
* **External signal**: lets you enable the outbound transition after receiving an external signal. Refer to the [External signal](../../workflow/using/external-signal.md) section.
* **Approval**: lets you send an email to an operator or a group of operators and wait for approval to continue with the execution. Refer to the [Approval](../../workflow/using/approval.md) section.
