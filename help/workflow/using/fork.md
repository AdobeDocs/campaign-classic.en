# Fork{#fork}

A fork lets you activate all its outbound activities in parallel.

For example, you can use the activity in the context of content creation and delivery sending automation, in order to launch the target calculation and the content creation at the same time. A dedicated use case is available in [this section](../../delivery/using/automating-via-workflows.md#creating-the-delivery-and-its-content).

To configure the activity, open it then define the number and label of the desired outbound transitions.
