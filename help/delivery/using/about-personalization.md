# Get started with personalization{#about-personalization}

Messages delivered by Adobe Campaign can be personalized in several different ways, concerning the content or the appearance of messages. These ways can be combined according to criteria taken particularly from the recipient profiles. For email deliveries, you can define the elements and personalization conditions of a delivery directly in JavaScript from the **[!UICONTROL Source]** tab of the message. In general, Adobe Campaign allows you to:

* Personalize the message format. See [Message content](defining-the-email-content.md#message-content).
* Insert dynamic personalization fields. See [Personalization fields](personalization-fields.md).
* Insert predefined personalization blocks. See [Personalization blocks](personalization-blocks.md).
* Create conditional content. Refer to the [Conditional content](conditional-content.md) section.

>[!CAUTION]
>
>The following variables are internal variables that can be used for personalization but must not be modified: **delivery**, **message**, **dataSource**, **targetData**, **provider**, **coupon**, **couponValue**, **proposition**.


With Adobe Campaign, personalize your deliveries to send messages that match each recipientâ€™s profile and interests.

Personalization helps you make your messages more relevant and engaging. You can use recipient data to adapt content, add dynamic fields, or display different information based on conditions. Learn how to set up and use personalization features in your deliveries in [Adobe Campaign v8 documentation](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/campaign/campaign-v8/send/personalize/personalize.html){target=_blank}.

As part of the Campaign v8 promotion initiative, the Campaign Classic documentation has been reorganized. Common features are now only available in the Campaign v8 documentation set.
