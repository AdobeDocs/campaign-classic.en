# Get started with personalization{#about-personalization}

With Adobe Campaign, personalize your deliveries to send messages that match each recipientâ€™s profile and interests.

Personalization helps you make your messages more relevant and engaging. You can use recipient data to adapt content, add dynamic fields, or display different information based on conditions. Learn how to set up and use personalization features in your deliveries in [Adobe Campaign v8 documentation](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/campaign/campaign-v8/send/personalize/personalize.html){target=_blank}.

As part of the Campaign v8 promotion initiative, the Campaign Classic documentation has been reorganized. Common features are now only available in the Campaign v8 documentation set.
