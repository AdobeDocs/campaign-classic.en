# Create notifications for Android{#create-notificaations-android}

Use Adobe Campaign to send push notifications on Android devices. Global concepts on delivery creation are presented in [this section](steps-about-delivery-creation-steps.md).

Start by creating a new delivery.

With Firebase Cloud Messaging, you can choose between two types of messages:

* **[!UICONTROL Data message]**, handled by the client app.
   <br>Messages are sent directly to the mobile application which will generate and display the android notification to the device. Data messages contain only your custom application variables.

* **[!UICONTROL Notification message]**, handled automatically by the FCM SDK.
   <br> FCM automatically displays the message on your users' devices on behalf of the client app. Notification messages contain a predefined set of parameters and options but can still be further personalized with custom application variables.

For more information on Firebase Cloud Messaging messages types, refer to [FCM documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/concept-options#notifications_and_data_messages){target="_blank"}.
