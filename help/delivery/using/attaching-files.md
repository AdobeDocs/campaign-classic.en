## About email attachments {#about-email-attachments}

You can attach one or more files to an email delivery.

>[!NOTE]
>
>To avoid performance issue, it is recommended not to include more than one attachment per email. The recommended threshold can be configured from [the list of Campaign Classic options](../../installation/using/configuring-campaign-options.md#delivery).

There are two possible cases:

* Select a file and attach it to the delivery as it is.
* Personalize the content of the attachment for each recipient. In this case, you need to create a **calculated attachment**: the name of the attachment is computed at the time of delivery for each message depending on the recipient. The content can also be personalized and converted into PDF format at the time of delivery, if you have the **Variable Digital Printing** option.

>[!NOTE]
>
>This type of configuration is generally carried out in the delivery templates. For more on this, refer to [About templates](../../delivery/using/about-templates.md).

## Attach a local file {#attaching-a-local-file}

Once the file is selected, it is immediately uploaded onto the server to be available at the time of delivery. It is listed in the **[!UICONTROL Attachments]** field.

## Create a calculated attachment {#creating-a-calculated-attachment}

When you create a calculated attachment, the name of the attachment can be computed during analysis or delivery of each message and can depend on the recipient. It can also be personalized and converted to PDF.

### Attaching a local file {#attach-a-local-file}

If the attachment is a local file, select the option: **[!UICONTROL File name is specified when creating the delivery template]**. The file is selected locally and uploaded onto the server. Follow the steps below:

1. Select the file to upload in the **[!UICONTROL Local file]** field.
1. Specify the label if necessary. The label replaces the filename when viewed in messaging systems. If nothing is specified, the filename is used by default.

The file is then available on the server to be attached to the different deliveries created from this template.

### Attach a personalized message {#attach-a-personalized-message}

The option **[!UICONTROL The file content is personalized and converted into PDF format at the time of delivery for each message]** lets you select a file with personalization fields, such as the last name and first name of the intended recipient.

>To avoid performance issue, if you include images downloaded on the fly from a personalized URL as attachment, each image size should not exceed 100,000 bytes by default. This recommended threshold can be configured from [the list of Campaign Classic options](../../installation/using/configuring-campaign-options.md#delivery).

### Attachment settings {#attachment-settings}

For a change of file, a warning message is displayed:

![](assets/s_ncs_user_wizard_email01_1372.png)

The **[!UICONTROL Advanced]** tab lets you define advanced options on attached files:

* You can define filter options to avoid sending the attached file to all recipients. The option **[!UICONTROL Enable filtering of recipients who will receive the attachment]** activates an input field used to define a recipient selection script, which must be entered in JavaScript.
* You can script the name of the file in order to personalize it.

  Enter your text in the window and use the personalization fields available in the drop-down list. In the following example, the filename is personalized to contain today's date and the name of the recipient.
