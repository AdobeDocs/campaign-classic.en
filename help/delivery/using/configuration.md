# Configuration{#configuration}

The functionalities of the **Deliverability** module are managed by two technical workflows. They only work if the HTTPS feed is open for **deliverability.neolane.net**.

* The **Update test network for Inbox Rendering** workflow lets you recover the target addresses used when sending proofs.

  For more on this, refer to [Inbox rendering](../../delivery/using/inbox-rendering.md). 

* The **Refresh for deliverability** workflow is installed by default on all instances and lets you initialize the list of bounce mail qualification rules, the list of domains and the list of MXs. Once the **Deliverability** module is installed, the list of rules is updated regularly and you may actively manage platform deliverability.

  For more on this, refer to [Bounce mail qualification](../../delivery/using/configuration.md#bounce-mail-qualification).
