# Configuration{#configuration}

For hosted and hybrid clients, **Deliverability monitoring** is configured on your instance by Adobe technical support and consultants. For more information, contact your Adobe Account executive.
 
For on-premise installations, you must install the **[!UICONTROL Deliverability monitoring (Email Deliverability)]** package via the **[!UICONTROL Tools]** > **[!UICONTROL Advanced]** > **[!UICONTROL Import package]** menu. For more on this, see [Installing Campaign Classic standard packages](../../installation/using/installing-campaign-standard-packages.md).
 
**Deliverability monitoring** is managed by the **[!UICONTROL Refresh for deliverability]** workflow. It is installed by default on all instances and lets you initialize the list of bounce mail qualification rules, the list of domains and the list of MXs. Once the **[!UICONTROL Deliverability monitoring (Email Deliverability)]** package is installed, this workflow runs nightly to regularly update the list of rules and enables you to actively manage platform deliverability.
