# Get started with the app configuration

You can find in this section a configuration sample based on a company which sells online holiday packages. His mobile application (Neotrips) is available to its customers in two versions: Neotrips for Android and Neotrips for iOS.

To send push notifications in Adobe Campaign, you need to:

* Create a **[!UICONTROL Mobile application]** type information service for the Neotrips mobile application. Refer to [this section for iOS](../../delivery/using/configuring-the-mobile-application.md#configuring-ios-service). and [this section for Android](../../delivery/using/configuring-the-mobile-application-android.md#configuring-android-service).
* Add the iOS and Android versions of the application to this service.
* Create a delivery for both iOS and Android. [Refer to this page](../../delivery/using/creating-notifications.md).

>Go to the **[!UICONTROL Subscriptions]** tab of the service to view the list of subscribers to the service, i.e. all people who have installed the application on their mobile and agreed to receive notifications.
