Use Adobe Campaign to send personalized SMS messages.

Before starting sending SMS:

* Make sure recipient profiles contain at least a mobile phone in their profile.
* Learn more about the Adobe Campaign [Delivery best practices](delivery-best-practices.md).

The key steps to send a SMS are as follows:

* [Configure the SMS channel](sms-set-up.md)
* [Create a SMS delivery](sms-create.md)
* [Define the audience](sms-create.md#selecting-the-target-population)
* [Define the SMS content](sms-create.md#defining-the-sms-content)
* [Send, monitor and track SMS](sms-send.md)
* [Troubleshoot](troubleshooting-sms.md)

In addition, you need to be familiar with SMS protocol and settings. Walk through the connection set up between Adobe Campaign and a SMPP provider in [this document](sms-protocol.md)

For global information on how to create a delivery, refer to [this section](steps-about-delivery-creation-steps.md).
