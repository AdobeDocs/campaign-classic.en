# Get started with SMS channel{#sms-channel}

Use Adobe Campaign to send text messages to your customers on their mobile devices. You can create, personalize, and preview messages in text format from the SMS editor.

SMS is a direct and highly effective channel for reaching your users wherever they are. With high open rates and near-instant delivery, SMS is ideal for time-sensitive alerts, transactional updates, and concise promotional messages. Use SMS to complement your cross-channel strategy and deliver impactful, real-time communication. Learn how to configure and use the SMS channel effectively in the [Adobe Campaign v8 documentation](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/campaign/campaign-v8/send/sms/sms.html){target=_blank}.

As part of the Campaign v8 promotion initiative, the Campaign Classic documentation has been reorganized. Common features are now only available in the Campaign v8 documentation set.
