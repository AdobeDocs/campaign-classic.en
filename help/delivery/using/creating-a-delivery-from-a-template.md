# Creating a delivery from a template{#creating-a-delivery-from-a-template}

## Linking the template to a delivery {#linking-the-template-to-a-delivery}

To create a delivery based on an existing template, select the template from the list of available delivery templates. 

![](assets/s_ncs_user_wizard_select_template.png)

Otherwise, click the **Select link** folder to the right of the field to browse the tree.

Select the desired directory from the **Folder** field, or click the **Display sub-levels** icon to display the contents of the directories in the sub-trees of the current directory.

Select the delivery template to be used, and click **Ok**.

## Executing the template {#executing-the-template}

You can launch the execution of a template directly from the template list without creating a delivery first. To do this, select the template to be executed and right-click. Select **Actions>Execute the delivery template...**.

You can also use **File>Actions>Execute the delivery template...**. 

![](assets/s_ncs_user_template_execute_menu.png)

Enter the delivery parameters and click **Send**.

This action generates a delivery in the folder attached to the template. The name of this delivery is the name of the delivery template from which it was created.
