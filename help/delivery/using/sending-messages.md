# Main steps to send an email {#confirming-email-delivery}

Once your email has been created and configured, you can send it to the main target. This section presents the main steps to check and confirm the delivery of an email.

1. Make sure you configured all the settings that are specific to email delivery. For more on this, see [Email parameters](../../delivery/using/email-parameters.md).
1. When the email is ready, before sending it to the main target, it is recommended to detect any potential errors by sending proofs. For more on this, see [Sending a proof](../../delivery/using/steps-validating-the-delivery.md#sending-a-proof).

1. Once done, you must validate the email by launching the analysis. To do this, click **[!UICONTROL Send]**, select an action and click **[!UICONTROL Analyze]**. For more on this, see [Launching the analysis](../../delivery/using/steps-validating-the-delivery.md#analyzing-the-delivery).

1. Once analysis is complete, click **[!UICONTROL Confirm delivery]** to launch the delivery of messages to the targeted recipients. For more on this, see [Confirming delivery](../../delivery/using/steps-sending-the-delivery.md#confirming-delivery).

    <!--Add screenshot with analysis done and Confirm delivery button activated.-->
