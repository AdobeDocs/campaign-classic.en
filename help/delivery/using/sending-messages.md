# Sending an email{#sending-an-email}

When a delivery has been created and configured, you must validate it before sending it to the main target. For more on this, see [Validating the delivery](../../delivery/using/steps-validating-the-delivery.md).

When the delivery is validated and ready for send, click **[!UICONTROL Send]** to approve your email and send it to the recipients of the delivery being created.

Select an action and click **[!UICONTROL Analyze]** to run the analysis. For more on this, see [Launching the analysis](../../delivery/using/steps-validating-the-delivery.md#analyzing-the-delivery).
