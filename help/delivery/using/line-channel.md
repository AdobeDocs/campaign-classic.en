# Create LINE deliveries{#line-channel}

With Adobe Campaign, use the LINE channel to send rich, engaging messages directly to users on their LINE app. Whether for announcements, promotions, customer service updates, or multimedia content, LINE offers a real-time conversational medium that complements your other channels. 

Learn how to set up the LINE channel, create end delivery, define the content type and monitor delivery performance in [Adobe Campaign v8 documentation](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/campaign/campaign-v8/send/line.md){target=_blank}.

As part of the Campaign v8 promotion initiative, the Campaign Classic documentation has been reorganized. Common features are now only available in the Campaign v8 documentation set.
