# Create LINE deliveries{#line-channel}

 

[!DNL LINE] is an application for free instant messaging, voice and video calls, available on every mobile OS and on PC.

[!DNL LINE] can also be combined with the transactional message module to send real time messages on the [!DNL LINE] app installed in consumer mobile devices. For more on this, refer to this [page](../../message-center/using/transactional-messaging-architecture.md#transactional-messaging-and-line).

The steps for using the [!DNL LINE] channel are:

1. [Set up LINE channel](#setting-up-line-channel)
1. [Create a delivery](#creating-the-delivery)
1. [Configure the content type](#defining-the-content)
1. [Monitoring the delivery (tracking, quarantining, reports, etc.)](#accessing-reports)

## Define the content type {#defining-the-content}

To define the content of a [!DNL LINE] delivery, you first have to add message type to your delivery. Each [!DNL LINE] delivery can contain up to 5 messages.

You can choose between three message types:

* [Text message](#configuring-a-text-message-delivery)
* [Image and link](#configuring-an-image-and-link-delivery)
* [Video message](#configuring-a-video-message-delivery)

### Configuring a Text message delivery {#configuring-a-text-message-delivery}

>[!NOTE]
>
>The `<%@ include option='NmsServer_URL' %>/webApp/APP3?id=<%=escapeUrl(cryptString(visitor.id))%>` syntax allows you to include a link to a web app in a LINE message.

A **[!UICONTROL Text message]** [!DNL LINE] delivery is a message sent to recipients in text form. 

![](assets/line_message_02.png)

The configuration for this type of message is similar to the configuration of the **[!UICONTROL Text]** in an email. For more information, refer to this [page](defining-the-email-content.md#message-content).

### Configuring an Image and link delivery {#configuring-an-image-and-link-delivery}

An **[!UICONTROL Image and link]** [!DNL LINE] delivery is a message sent to recipients in the form of an image that may contain one or multiple URLs.

You can use:

* a **[!UICONTROL Personalized image]**,

  >[!NOTE]
  >
  >You can use the **%SIZE%** variable to optimize the image display according to the screen size of the recipient's mobile device.

  ![](assets/line_message_04.png)

* an **[!UICONTROL Image URL]** per device screen size,

  ![](assets/line_message_03.png)

  The **[!UICONTROL Define images per device screen size]** option allows you to use different image resolutions to optimize delivery visibility on mobile devices. Only images with same height and width are supported.

  Images can be defined according to the screen size:

  * 1040px
  * 700px
  * 460px
  * 300px
  * 240px

  >[!CAUTION]
  >
  >The 1040x1040 px size is mandatory for every LINE image with link.

  You then have to add alternative text that will pop up on the recipient's mobile device.

* and **[!UICONTROL Links]**.

  The **[!UICONTROL Links]** section allows you to choose between different layouts that will divide your image in multiple clickable regions. You can then assign each of them a dedicated **[!UICONTROL Link URL]**.

  ![](assets/line_message_05.png)

### Configuring a Video message delivery {#configuring-a-video-message-delivery}

A **[!UICONTROL Video message]** [!DNL LINE] delivery is a message sent to recipients in the form of a video that can contain an URL.

The **[!UICONTROL Preview Image URL]** field allows you to add the URL of a preview image with a character limit of 1000. JPEG and PNG are supported with a file size limit of 1 MB.

The **[!UICONTROL Video Image URL]** field allows you to add the URL of your video file with a character limit of 1000. Only mp4 format is supported with a file size limit of 200 MB.

## Accessing reports {#accessing-reports}

After sending your delivery, you can view your [!DNL LINE] reports via the menu **[!UICONTROL Campaign Management]** > **[!UICONTROL Deliveries]** from the **[!UICONTROL Explorer]**.
   
   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >The tracking reports indicate the click-through rate. [!DNL LINE] does not take the open rate into account.
