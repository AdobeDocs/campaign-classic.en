# Personalization blocks{#personalization-blocks}

Personalization blocks are dynamic, personalized and contain a specific rendering that you can insert into your deliveries. For example, you can add a logo, a greeting message, or a link to a mirror page. See [Inserting personalization blocks](#inserting-personalization-blocks).

Personalization blocks are accessed via the **[!UICONTROL Resources > Campaign Management > Personalization blocks]** node of the Adobe Campaign explorer. Several blocks are available by default (see [Out-of-the-box personalization blocks](#out-of-the-box-personalization-blocks)).

You have the ability to define new blocks that will enable you to optimize your deliveries personalization. For more on this, refer to [Defining custom personalization blocks](#defining-custom-personalization-blocks).

>[!NOTE]

>Personalization blocks are also available from the **[!UICONTROL Digital Content Editor (DCE)]** . For more on this, refer to [this page](../../web/using/editing-content.md#inserting-a-personalization-block).

## Personalization blocks example {#personalization-blocks-example}

In this example, we create an email in which we use personalization blocks to enable the recipient to view the mirror page, share the newsletter on social networks, and unsubscribe from future deliveries.

To do this, we need to insert the following personalization blocks:

* **[!UICONTROL Link to mirror page]** .
* **[!UICONTROL Social network sharing links]** .
* **[!UICONTROL Unsubscription link]** .

>[!NOTE]
>
>For more on the mirror page generation, refer to [Generating the mirror page](../../delivery/using/sending-messages.md#generating-the-mirror-page).

1. Create a new delivery or open an existing email type delivery.
1. In the delivery wizard, click **[!UICONTROL Subject]** to edit the subject of the message and enter a subject.
1. Insert the personalization blocks in the message body. To do this, click in the message content, click the personalized field icon and select the **[!UICONTROL Include]** menu.
1. Select the first block to insert. Renew the procedure to include the two other blocks.

   ![](assets/s_ncs_user_personalized_block_example.png)

1. Click the **[!UICONTROL Preview]** tab to view the personalization result. You must select a recipient to display that recipient's message.

## Out-of-the-box personalization blocks {#out-of-the-box-personalization-blocks}

A list of personalization blocks is available by default to help you personalize the content of your message.

>[!NOTE]
>
>The list of personalization blocks depends on the modules and options which have been installed on your instance.

![](assets/s_ncs_user_personalized_block_list.png)

* **[!UICONTROL Greetings]** : inserts greetings with the recipient's name. Example: "Hello John Doe,".
* **[!UICONTROL Insert logo]** : inserts an out-of-the-box logo that has been defined when configuring the instance.
* **[!UICONTROL Powered by Adobe Campaign]** : inserts the "Powered by Adobe Campaign" logo.
* **[!UICONTROL Mirror page URL]** : inserts the mirror page URL, enabling Delivery Designers to check the link.

  In the example below, the function is used to replace the element "My header" by "My new header" with uppercase letters at each word:

  ```
  <h1 id="sample">My header</h1>
  <script><%@ include view='toSmartCase'%>;
  document.getElementById("sample").innerHTML = toSmartCase("My new header");
  </script>
