# Work with delivery templates {#about-templates}

A delivery configuration can be saved in a delivery template in order to be re-used. The template may contain a complete or partial configuration of the delivery.

There are two types of template:

1. Adobe Campaign native delivery templates - Native templates MUST NOT be deleted from the system. They include a minimum configuration for each delivery channel. The administrator can, however, restrict certain functions or offer default values to users (tracking activation, sender email addresses, etc.). Native scenarios appear in bold in the list of templates. They must be duplicated in order to modify them.

1. Predefined delivery templates - The Adobe Campaign administrator can create new delivery templates. They can be reused by operators (those with suitable access rights) or automatically by server processes. For example, you can configure an email delivery template, and when users creates a delivery using this template, they simply need to enter the text or HTML content and then deliver it; the other choices have already been defined by the administrator.
