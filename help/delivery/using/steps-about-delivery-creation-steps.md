    * [Email channel](defining-the-email-content.md)
    * [SMS channel](sms-create.md#defining-the-sms-content)
    * [Direct mail channel](defining-the-direct-mail-content.md)

1. **Define the target population**. [Read more](steps-defining-the-target-population.md)

1. **Send the delivery**. [Read more](steps-sending-the-delivery.md)

1. **Monitor the delivery** (tracking, quarantine, reports, etc.). For more on this, refer to the [Monitoring deliveries](about-delivery-monitoring.md) and [Tracking deliveries](about-message-tracking.md) sections.
