# About delivery creation {#about-delivery-creation}

The key steps when creating a delivery are as follows:

1. Create and identify the delivery. [Read more](../../delivery/using/steps-create-and-identify-the-delivery.md)

1. Define the delivery content.

    The delivery content definition is specific to each channel. For more on this, refer to the dedicated section:

    * [Defining the email content](../../delivery/using/defining-the-email-content.md)
    * [Defining the SMS content](../../delivery/using/sms-channel.md#defining-the-sms-content)
    * [Defining the direct mail content](../../delivery/using/defining-the-direct-mail-content.md)
    * [Push notifications](../../delivery/using/about-mobile-app-channel.md)

1. Define the target population. [Read more](../../delivery/using/steps-defining-the-target-population.md)

1. Send the delivery. [Read more](../../delivery/using/steps-sending-the-delivery.md)

1. Monitor the delivery (tracking, quarantine, reports, etc.). For more on this, refer to the [Monitoring deliveries](../../delivery/using/monitoring-a-delivery.md) and [Tracking deliveries](../../delivery/using/about-message-tracking.md) sections.

>[!NOTE]
>
>The steps described in this chapter assume that all target recipients and their profiles are stored in the database, except in the case of external delivery (see [Selecting external recipients](../../delivery/using/steps-defining-the-target-population.md#selecting-external-recipients)).
