    * [SMS channel](../../delivery/using/sms-create.md#defining-the-sms-content)
    * [Direct mail channel](../../delivery/using/defining-the-direct-mail-content.md)
    * [Mobile application channel](../../delivery/using/about-mobile-app-channel.md)

1. **Send the delivery**. [Read more](../../delivery/using/steps-sending-the-delivery.md)

1. **Monitor the delivery** (tracking, quarantine, reports, etc.). For more on this, refer to the [Monitoring deliveries](../../delivery/using/about-delivery-monitoring.md) and [Tracking deliveries](../../delivery/using/about-message-tracking.md) sections.
