# Monitoring deliverability {#monitoring-deliverability}

Below you will find details on the **Delivery throughput** report as well as the different monitoring tools offered by Adobe Campaign. Here are some additional guidelines on deliverability monitoring.

## Monitoring tools

Use the tools offered by Adobe Campaign to monitor your platform's deliverability.

* Overview of message quality (inbox, spam)
* What are the tools available apart from the Campaign basic reports?

You can also use:

* The **[!UICONTROL Delivery throughput]** report which gives you an overview of the entire platform's throughput for a given period. For more information on this report, refer to this page.
* The **[!UICONTROL Technical deliverability monitoring]** report which includes a number of deliverability quality indicators for your platform. Learn more about this report in this page.

## Monitoring guidelines

Here are some additional guidelines on deliverability monitoring:

* Regularly check the delivery throughput for the whole platform to verify whether it is consistent with the original set-up.
* Check that retries are set up correctly (30 minutes for retry period and more than 20 retries) in delivery templates.
* Regularly verify that the bounce mailbox is accessible and that the account is not about to expire.
* Check each delivery throughput to make sure that it is consistent with the delivery content's validity (e.g. 'flash sales' should be delivered in minutes, not days).
* When using waves, verify that each wave has enough time to finish before the next one is triggered.
* Check that the number of errors and new quarantines are consistent with other deliveries.
* Carefully consult the delivery logs in detail to check the kind of errors that are highlighted (grey or black-listing, DNS issues, anti-spam rules, etcâ€¦).

## Signal Spam
