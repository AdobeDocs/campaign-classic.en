## Converting an existing delivery to a template {#converting-an-existing-delivery-to-a-template}

A delivery can be converted to a template for new repeated delivery actions. To convert a delivery to a template, select it from the delivery list, accessible via the **[!UICONTROL Campaign management]** node of the tree.

Right-click and select **[!UICONTROL Actions > Save as template...]**.

This action creates a delivery template from the selected delivery. You must enter the folder where it is saved (in the **[!UICONTROL Folder]** field) as well as the folder where the deliveries created based on this template are created (in the **[!UICONTROL Execution folder]** field).
