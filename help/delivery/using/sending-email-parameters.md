# Sending an email{#sending-an-email}

This section details the options and parameters that are specific to delivering emails.

## Selecting message formats {#selecting-message-formats}

You can change the format of email messages sent. To do this, edit the delivery properties and click the **[!UICONTROL Delivery]** tab.

Select the format of the email in the lower section of the window:

* **[!UICONTROL Use recipient preferences]** (default mode)

  The message format is defined according to the data stored in the recipient profile and stored by default in the **[!UICONTROL email format]** field (@emailFormat). If a recipient wishes to receive messages in a certain format, this is the format sent. If the field is not filled in, a multipart-alternative message is sent (see below).

* **[!UICONTROL Let recipient mail client choose the most appropriate format]**

  The message contains both formats: text and HTML. The format displayed on reception depends on the configuration of the recipient's mail software (multipart-alternative).

  >[!IMPORTANT]
  >
  >This option includes both versions of the document. It therefore impacts the delivery rate, because the message size is greater.

* **[!UICONTROL Send all messages in text format]**

  The message is sent in text format. HTML format will not be sent, but used for the mirror page only when the recipient clicks on the message.

## Managing bounce emails {#managing-bounce-emails}

The **[!UICONTROL SMTP]** tab of the delivery parameters lets you configure the management of bounce mails.

By default, bounced emails are received in the default error box of the platform, but you can define a specific error address for a delivery.

You can also define a specific address from this screen in order to investigate the reasons for bounce mails when these could not be automatically qualified by the application. For each of these fields, the 'add personalized fields' icon lets you add personalization parameters.

## Character encoding {#character-encoding}

In the **[!UICONTROL SMTP]** tab of the delivery parameters, the **[!UICONTROL Character encoding]** section allows you to set a specific encoding.

The default encoding is UTF-8. If some of your recipients' email providers do not support the UTF-8 standard encoding, you may want to set a specific encoding to properly display the special characters to your emails' recipients.

For example, you want to send an email containing Japanese characters. To make sure that all characters will be correctly displayed to your recipients in Japan, you may want to use an encoding that will support the Japanese characters rather than the standard UTF-8.

To do this, select the **[!UICONTROL Force the encoding used for messages]** option in the **[!UICONTROL Character encoding]** section and choose an encoding from the drop-down list that is displayed.

## Adding SMTP headers {#adding-smtp-headers}

It is possible to add SMTP headers to your deliveries. To do this, use the relevant section of the **[!UICONTROL SMTP]** tab in the delivery.

The script entered in this window must reference one header per line in the following form: **name:value**.

Values are encoded automatically if necessary.

>[!CAUTION]
>
>Adding a script for inserting additional SMTP headers is reserved for advanced users.
>
>The syntax of this script must comply with the requirements of this content type: no unused space, no empty line, etc.
