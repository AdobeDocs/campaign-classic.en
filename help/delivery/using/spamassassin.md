# SpamAssassin{#spamassassin}

Adobe Campaign can be configured to work with [SpamAssassin](https://spamassassin.apache.org), a third-party service used for email spam filtering. This allows you to score emails to determine whether a message runs the risk of being considered as spam by the anti-spam tools used upon receipt.

SpamAssassin leverages a variety of spam-detection techniques, including:

* DNS-based and fuzzy-checksum-based spam detection
* Bayesian filtering
* External programs
* Denylists
* Online databases

>[!NOTE]
>
>SpamAssassin must be installed and configured on the Adobe Campaign application server. For more on this, refer to [this section](../../installation/using/configuring-spamassassin.md).
>
>The rules that govern whether an element is spam or not are managed via SpamAssassin and can be edited by an administrator with privileges.
