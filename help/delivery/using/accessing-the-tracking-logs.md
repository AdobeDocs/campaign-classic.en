# Accessing the tracking logs{#accessing-the-tracking-logs}

When the delivery has been sent and tracking activated, the **Tracking** technical workflow is in charge of retrieving the tracking data. It is executed hourly by default.

This information appears in the **Tracking** tab of the profile of recipients targeted by the delivery, as in the following example:

It is also accessible via the **Tracking** tab of the delivery.

>If you cannot see the **Tracking** tab of a delivery, it means that tracking has not been activated. Refer to [this section](../../delivery/using/how-to-configure-tracked-links.md).
