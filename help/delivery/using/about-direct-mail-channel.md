# About direct mail channel{#about-direct-mail-channel}

 

Adobe Campaign lets you produce files to mass deliver personalized letters. The recipient profiles must contain at least their names and postal addresses.

>[!NOTE]
>
>Postal addresses are calculated fields. An address can contain up to six lines by default: the first contains the first name and last name, the next lines contain the postal address (road etc.), and the last line contains the ZIP/Postal code and town or city.  
>An address is considered to be complete if the name, ZIP/Postal code field, and town/city fields are not empty.

The sections below provide information that is specific to the direct mail channel. For global information on how to create and send a delivery, refer to [this section](steps-about-delivery-creation-steps.md).
