# Restoration{#restoration}

On a clean server, the restoration procedure is as follows:

* on an installed and configured operating system (networks),
* install third-party applications: Web server, JDK (if necessary),
* install Adobe Campaign binaries with the same build as the source system,
* copy configuration files, tracking logs and redirection files,
* create and rebuild the database,
* start Adobe Campaign.

For more information, refer to the **Installation Guide**.
