>Discover more about the Audit trail functionality in the [Adobe Campaign v8 documentation](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/campaign/campaign-v8/analytics/audit-trail).

In Adobe Campaign, the **[!UICONTROL Audit trail]** gives you access to the complete history of changes made within your instance.

**[!UICONTROL Audit trail]** captures, in real-time, a comprehensive list of actions and events occurring within your Adobe Campaign instance. It includes a self-serve way to access a history of data to help answer questions such as: what happened to your workflows, and who last updated them or what did your users do in the instance.

>[!NOTE]
>
>Adobe Campaign is not auditing changes made within user rights, templates, personalization or campaigns.  
>Audit trail can only be managed by administrators of the instance.
