# Audit trail{#audit-trail}

In Adobe Campaign, the **[!UICONTROL Audit trail]** gives you access to the complete history of changes made within your instance.

**[!UICONTROL Audit trail]** captures, in real-time, a comprehensive list of actions and events occurring within your Adobe Campaign instance. It includes a self-serve way to access a history of data to help answer questions such as: what happened to your workflows, and who last updated them or what did your users do in the instance.

>[!NOTE]
>
>Adobe Campaign is not auditing changes made within user rights, templates, personalization or campaigns.  
>Audit trail can only be managed by administrators of the instance.

Audit Trail consists of three components:

* **Schema audit trail**: Check the activities and last modifications done to your schemas.

  For more information on schemas, refer to this [page](../../configuration/using/data-schemas.md).

* **Workflow audit trail**: Check activities and last modifications done to workflows, and additionally, the state of your workflows such as:

    * Start
    * Pause
    * Stop
    * Restart
    * Cleanup which equals to the action Purge history
    * Simulate which equals to the action Start in simulation mode
    * Wakeup which equals to the action Execute pending tasks now
    * Unconditional Stop

  For more information on workflows, refer to this [page](../../workflow/using/about-workflows.md).
  
  For more on how to monitor workflows, refer to the [dedicated section](../../workflow/using/monitoring-workflow-execution.md).

* **Option audit trail**: Check the activities and last modifications done to your options.

  For more information on options, refer to this [page](../../installation/using/configuring-campaign-options.md).
