# Connection thresholds{#connection-thresholds}



For heavily loaded servers, the connection threshold might be exceeded. In any event, it is useful to find out why.

There are three different thresholds:

* The **Web connection threshold**, configured in your web server. To modify it, contact your system administrator.

* The **database connection threshold**. To modify it, contact your database administrator.

* The **Adobe Campaign connection threshold**, available in two places:

    * **Tomcat** side: all queries actually arriving on the Adobe Campaign Tomcat client.

      This threshold is configured in the **nl6/tomcat-8/conf/server.xml** file. The **maxThreads** attribute lets you increase the threshold of the number of queries processed at a time. It can be changed to 250, for instance.

      ```    
      <Connector protocol="HTTP/1.1" port="8080"
                     maxThreads="75"
                     minSpareThreads="5"
                     enableLookups="true" redirectPort="8443"
                     acceptCount="100" connectionTimeout="20000"
                     disableUploadTimeout="true" />
          <Engine name="Tomcat-Standalone" defaultHost="localhost">
            <Host name="localhost" appBase="./"
                  unpackWARs="true" autoDeploy="true">
      ```

    * **Database**: set of all connections open at the same time on the database by a process.

      This threshold is configured in the file **nl6/conf/serverConf.xml**. The **maxCnx** attribute located in **datasource pool** lets you increase the threshold of queries processed simultaneously.

      ```    
          <!-- Data source
               -->
            <dataSource name="default">
              <dbcnx NChar="" bulkCopyUtility="" dbSchema="" encrypted="" login="" password="" provider="" server="" timezone="" unicodeData="" useTimestampTZ=""/>
              <sqlParams funcPrefix="">
                <postConnectSQL/>
              </sqlParams>
              <pool aliveTestDelaySec="600" freeCnx="0" maxCnx="90" maxIdleDelaySec="1200"/>
            </dataSource>
      ```
