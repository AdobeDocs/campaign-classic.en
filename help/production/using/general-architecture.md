# General architecture{#general-architecture}

## Minimum architecture {#minimum-architecture}

In a minimum configuration, Adobe Campaign operates with:

* the Adobe Campaign application server,
* the database.

  ![](assets/formation_exploitation.png)

This diagram shows that the only traffic involved in the context of a minimum architecture is:

1. HTTP protocol traffic to the Adobe Campaign server via the Internet,
1. SMTP protocol traffic from and to the Adobe Campaign server via the Internet.

## Distributed architecture {#distributed-architecture}

Adobe Campaign is made up of multiple modules which can be broken down over several machines. This operating mode has several advantages:

* load balancing,
* setting up of module redundancy,
* building of an architecture broken down over several service providers (segmentation of the services provided).

The distribution of modules over several machines provides great flexibility of use and improved adaptability.
