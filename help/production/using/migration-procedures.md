If you upgrade from Adobe Campaign v6 to v7, we recommend the following guidelines.

* On Windows, for both the client and server upgrade, uninstall Adobe Campaign v6 before installing v7. Don't forget to back up your log and configuration files beforehand.
* On Linux, for the server upgrade, remove the Adobe Campaign v6 package before installing v7.
