# Tracking logs issues{#tracking-logs-issues}

There can be multiple reasons for tracking logs not being forwarded. We recommend that you check the following information:

* Does the **Tracking** workflow have errors?

  Refer to [Monitoring technical workflows](../../workflow/using/monitoring-technical-workflows.md).

* Is the module **trackinglogd** running on the server?

  Refer to [Log files](../../production/using/log-files.md).

* Have changes been made? They can trigger a loss of connection to the servers using the tracking alias.
