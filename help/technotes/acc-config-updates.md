# Adobe Campaign configuration updates - March 2021 {#acc-config-updates}

Infrastructure and settings should be regularly updated with the latest builds and product fixes. These fixes are necessary to ensure continuity of service and security. In addition, upgrades will be required to align with third-party changes.

As a **Hosted or Managed Services customer**, Adobe will inform you of build upgrades at regular intervals. You will be required to upgrade in accordance with the recommendations to ensure compliance.

As an **On-premise or Hybrid customer**, you should upgrade your implementation at regular intervals in line with the latest released builds. 

For security reasons, you must now upgrade to one of the versions listed below. In addition to the standard upgrade steps, a few manual tasks must be performed to make sure that your environment is safe and ready for upcoming changes from Adobe or third-party systems.
