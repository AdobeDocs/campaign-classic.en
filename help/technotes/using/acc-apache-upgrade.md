# Adobe Campaign - Apache version security update {#apache-update}

Campaign Classic works with 3rd party tools, and compatibility is updated on a regular basis, in order to implement supported versions only.

The Adobe Campaign team will conduct the Apache version security upgrade activity by May 31, 2022 to mitigate an Apache vulnerability and make your instance environment more secure.   

This upgrade is expected to run automatically outside of your normal business hours for you to continue using the Campaign service without any major disruption. Your non-production instance(s) will be upgraded by our teams first before we upgrade your production instance(s). Since this is an auto upgrade process, there is no action required from your side. However, if you experience any issues, please contact [Adobe Customer Care](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/?support-solution=Campaign#support).   

Since the upgrade would need to restart the Apache, we expect the downtime will not exceed 10 minutes within the time slot mentioned below.
