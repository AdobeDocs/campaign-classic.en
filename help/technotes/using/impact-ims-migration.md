# Interface impact after IMS migration {#impact-ims-migration}

To enhance security and streamline the authentication process, Adobe Campaign strongly recommends migrating end-user authentication from the traditional login/password method to the Adobe Identity Management System (IMS). All operators should adopt [Adobe Identity Management System (IMS)](https://helpx.adobe.com/enterprise/using/identity.html) for accessing Campaign.

Once you have transitioned to IMS for end-user authentication, please be aware of the following changes in the user interface.

## Manage in Admin console {#manage-admin}

The administration of operators will be centralized in the Admin Console, and the following tasks will now be managed exclusively through this console:

* [Creating operators](https://helpx.adobe.com/enterprise/using/manage-users-individually.html#_blank)
* [Creating operator groups](https://helpx.adobe.com/enterprise/using/user-groups.html#Createusergroups)
* [Editing operators](https://helpx.adobe.com/ie/enterprise/using/manage-users-individually.html)
* [Editing operator groups](https://helpx.adobe.com/enterprise/using/user-groups.html#Editusergroups)
* [Assigning or updating operators' access rights](https://helpx.adobe.com/enterprise/using/manage-permissions-and-roles.html)
* [Deleting operators](https://helpx.adobe.com/enterprise/using/manage-users-individually.html#_blank)
* [Deleting operator groups](https://helpx.adobe.com/enterprise/using/user-groups.html#Removeusergroups)

## Unavailable after migration {#unavailable-migration}

After the migration, the following tasks will no longer be available:

* Using the [Merge Selected lines option](../../platform/using/updating-data.md#merge-data) to merge two operators.

* Updating the following fields for your operators:
    * Name
    * Password
    * Label
    * Email

* [Resetting your Campaign password](../../production/using/lost-password.md)

* Editing the XML source.

* Duplicating operators.
