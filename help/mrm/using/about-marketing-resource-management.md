# Get started with Marketing Resource Management{#about-marketing-resource-management} 



The **Marketing Resource Management (MRM)** module lets you control marketing actions in a collaborative mode by providing complete management and real-time tracking of the tasks, budgets and marketing resources involved. 

Adobe Campaign operators can coordinate their actions and approve their progress at all stages via complete validation processes and appropriate tracking tools: reporting, tracking of approvals, notifications, discussion forums, etc. They are alerted in the event or error or delay, and at each new stage of the validation cycle.

Thus, in the context of the programs and sub-programs of marketing plans, tasks can be created and assigned to the operators concerned, and then managed through all their phases.

**MRM** also lets you manage marketing resources in which multiple participants are involved: the integrity and monitoring of resources is performed via a dedicated dashboard.

Finally, budget management capability is extended to targets and expense lines management and extended built-in reports. You can then monitor and measure the productivity and performance of all marketing activities.
