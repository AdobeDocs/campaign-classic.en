# Publishing on Facebook{#publishing-on-facebook}

Once configuration is complete, Social Marketing lets you post publications on the walls of your Facebook pages.

## Limitations {#limitations}

The following limitations are inherent to Facebook.

* Messages may not exceed 1,000 characters.
* HTML is not supported.

## Creating the delivery {#creating-the-delivery}

Create a new delivery using the **[!UICONTROL Publish to a brand page]** delivery template.

![](assets/social_facebook_delivery_001.png)

## Selecting the main target {#selecting-the-main-target}

You need to select the page(s) which you want to post your publication on.

1. Click the **[!UICONTROL To]** link.

   ![](assets/social_facebook_delivery_010.png)

1. Click the **[!UICONTROL Add]** button.

   ![](assets/social_facebook_delivery_011.png)

   ![](assets/social_facebook_delivery_012.png)

1. In the **[!UICONTROL Folder]** field, select the service folder which contains the Facebook page. By default, pages are stored in the root of the **[!UICONTROL Facebook]** service folder. Then select the Facebook page which you want to post on.

## Selecting the proof target {#selecting-the-proof-target}

The **[!UICONTROL Target of the proofs]** tab lets you define the Facebook page which you want to use for testing deliveries before sending them out. We recommend creating a dedicated private Facebook page for this purpose. For more on creating a private Facebook page, refer to [Creating a test Facebook page](../../social/using/publishing-on-facebook-walls.md#creating-a-test-facebook-page). To select the proof target, apply the same steps as for the main target: [Selecting the main target](#selecting-the-main-target).

![](assets/social_facebook_delivery_004.png)

>[!NOTE]
>
>If you are using the same Facebook test page for all deliveries, you can save the proof target in the **[!UICONTROL Publish to a brand page]** delivery template, which is accessed via the **[!UICONTROL Resources > Templates > Delivery templates]** node. The proof target will be entered by default for each new delivery.

## Defining the audience {#defining-the-audience}

If you want to use local segments to refine the type of public authorized to view the publication, we recommend that you create one Facebook page per segment (for instance: Adobe Campaign Paris, Adobe Campaign London, etc.).

However it is also possible to use the audience filters used by Facebook. The **[!UICONTROL Audience]** tab of the **[!UICONTROL Select target window]** offers four filters:

* **[!UICONTROL Country]** 
* **[!UICONTROL Regions]** 
* **[!UICONTROL Cities]** 
* **[!UICONTROL Languages]**

>[!CAUTION]
>
>Use this function with care. In delivery reports, the **[!UICONTROL Number of fans]** indicator will not take these Facebook filters into account.
>
>Facebook may change the list of audience filters as well as their values.

## Defining message content {#defining-message-content}

Select the type of publication using the **[!UICONTROL Content type]** drop-down menu.

![](assets/social_facebook_delivery_006.png)

The following types of deliveries are available:

* a **[!UICONTROL Status]** 
* a **[!UICONTROL Status with a link]** 
* a **[!UICONTROL Status with a YouTube link]** 
* a **[!UICONTROL Photo album]**

### Publishing a status {#publishing-a-status}

A status type delivery can only contain text, as in the example below:

![](assets/social_facebook_delivery_008.png)

>[!NOTE]
>
>The preview may differ slightly from the final Facebook publication. We highly recommend sending a proof before final delivery for an exact rendering of the publication. Refer to [Sending the proof](#sending-the-proof).

## Configuring tracking {#configuring-tracking}

Tracking can be viewed in the delivery reports and in the **[!UICONTROL Edit > Tracking]** tab of the delivery and the service.

Clicks on the URL contained in the delivery are measured by Adobe Campaign. The number of clicks on the **[!UICONTROL Like]** button, the number of comments and the number of fans are measured by Facebook.

Tracking configuration is the same as for an email delivery. For more on this, refer to [this section](../../delivery/using/monitoring-a-delivery.md).

>[!NOTE]
>
>In the **[!UICONTROL Publish to a brand page]** delivery template, tracking is enabled by default.

## Sending the proof {#sending-the-proof}

We highly recommend sending a proof of your publication before the final delivery to view the exact rendering of the publication on a private Facebook test page. For more on creating a private Facebook test page, refer to [Creating a test Facebook page](../../social/using/publishing-on-facebook-walls.md#creating-a-test-facebook-page). The steps for selecting the target proof are detailed in [Selecting the proof target](#selecting-the-proof-target).

Proof delivery is identical to email deliveries. Refer to [this section](../../delivery/using/steps-validating-the-delivery.md#sending-a-proof).

## Sending the message {#sending-the-message}

1. Once the content is approved, click the **[!UICONTROL Send]** button.
1. Select **[!UICONTROL Deliver as soon as possible]** and click the **[!UICONTROL Analyze]** button.

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >The **[!UICONTROL Postpone the delivery]** option lets you postpone delivery to a later date.

   ![](assets/social_facebook_delivery_009.png)

1. Once the analysis is complete, check the result.
1. Click **[!UICONTROL Confirm delivery]**, then click **[!UICONTROL Yes]**.
