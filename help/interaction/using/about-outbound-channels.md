# About outbound channels{#about-outbound-channels}

Offers can be presented in various spaces using inbound or outbound channels. This chapter details outbound channels.

In order for an offer to be selected by the offer engine, it has to have been approved and be available in a live environment. For more on this, refer to [Approving and activating an offer](../../interaction/using/approving-and-activating-an-offer.md).

Offer presentation via an outbound communication channel is carried out via direct mail, email, or SMS campaigns etc., generally in batch mode (refer to [Glossary](../../interaction/using/glossary.md)). You can also use unitary mode, particularly with Message Center (for more on this, refer to the [Message Center](../../message-center/using/about-transactional-messaging.md) guide).

Various options are available for presenting an offer. For example, via a delivery, a campaign, delivery outlines or even via workflow activities.
