# Creating predefined filters{#creating-predefined-filters}

 Predefined filters let you create eligibility rules for the target population that can easily be re-used during offer creation. They are specific to each environment and take the offer parameters into account.

To create a filter, apply the following process:

1. Go to the **Administration** folder and select **Pre-defined offer filters**.
