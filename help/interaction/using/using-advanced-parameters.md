* Creating a test environment is detailed in the [Creating a test environment](../../interaction/using/creating-a-test-environment.md) section.
* You can modify standard engine behavior using hooks. For more on this, refer to the [Hooks](../../interaction/using/hooks.md) section 
* Finally, using Interaction with a distributed architecture is detailed in the [Distributed architectures](../../interaction/using/distributed-architectures.md) section.
