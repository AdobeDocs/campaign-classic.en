* You can use additional contextual data. Refer to the [Additional data](https://helpx.adobe.com/campaign/standard/interaction/using/additional-data.html) section.
* You can enrich the application contexts of the suggested offers via an incoming channel. To do this, the **nms:interaction** interaction schema must be extended.

* Creating a test environment is detailed in the [Creating a test environment](https://helpx.adobe.com/campaign/standard/interaction/using/creating-a-test-environment.html) section.
* You can modify standard engine behavior using hooks. For more on this, refer to the [Hooks](https://helpx.adobe.com/campaign/standard/interaction/using/hooks.html) section 
* Finally, using Interaction with a distributed architecture is detailed in the [Distributed architectures](https://helpx.adobe.com/campaign/standard/interaction/using/distributed-architectures.html) section.
