* You can use additional contextual data. Refer to the [Additional data](../../interaction/using/additional-data.md) section.
* You can enrich the application contexts of the suggested offers via an incoming channel. To do this, the **nms:interaction** interaction schema must be extended. Refer to the [Extension example](../../interaction/using/extension-example.md) section for the full procedure.
* Creating a test environment is detailed in the [Creating a test environment](../../interaction/using/creating-a-test-environment.md) section.
* You can modify standard engine behavior using hooks. For more on this, refer to the [Hooks](../../interaction/using/hooks.md) section 
* Finally, using Interaction with a distributed architecture is detailed in the [Distributed architectures](../../interaction/using/distributed-architectures.md) section.
