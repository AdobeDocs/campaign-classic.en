# Offer catalog overview{#offer-catalog-overview}

An offer catalog is always either made up of categories that then have sub-categories or of offers directly.

An offer catalog is part of a single environment, to be specified beforehand. Offers contained in this catalog can only be associated with the spaces specified in this environment.

Offer management is carried out via a tree of folders in the Adobe Campaign.

Before creating your offers, you must first specify an environment (see [Environments overview](../../interaction/using/environments-overview.md)). It will contain all the characteristics (eligibility, constraints on the target, presentation rules) of a set of offers, sorted into categories, as well as the list of their spaces.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>Creating the offer catalog, i.e. the categories and the offers, is the responsibility of the **[!UICONTROL Offer manager]**.
