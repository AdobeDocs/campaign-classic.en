# About offers simulation{#about-offers-simulation}

 

The **Simulation** module lets you test the distribution of offers belonging to a category or an environment before sending your proposition to recipients.

Simulation takes into account the contexts and eligibility rules previously applied to offers (refer to [Offer catalog overview](../../interaction/using/offer-catalog-overview.md)), as well as their presentation rules (refer to [Managing offer presentation](../../interaction/using/managing-offer-presentation.md)). This lets you test and refine various versions of your offer proposition without actually using an offer or over/under soliciting a target, since simulation has no impact on the targeted recipients.

To learn how to simulate an offer, read the steps below.
