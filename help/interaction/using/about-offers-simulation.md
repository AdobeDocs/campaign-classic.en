# About offers simulation{#about-offers-simulation}

The **Simulation** module lets you test the distribution of offers belonging to a category or an environment before sending your proposition to recipients.

Simulation takes into account the contexts and eligibility rules previously applied to offers (refer to [Offer catalog overview](../../interaction/using/offer-catalog-overview.md)), as well as their presentation rules (refer to [Managing offer presentation](../../interaction/using/managing-offer-presentation.md)). This lets you test and refine various versions of your offer proposition without actually using an offer or over/under soliciting a target, since simulation has no impact on the targeted recipients.

To learn how to simulate an offer, read the steps below.

## Main steps for creating a simulation {#main-steps-for-creating-a-simulation}

To run a simulation of your offers, apply the following steps:

1. In the **[!UICONTROL Profiles and Targets]** tab, click the **[!UICONTROL Simulations]** link, then click the **[!UICONTROL Create]** button.

1. Save and edit the simulation which you have just created.
1. Go to the **[!UICONTROL Edit]** tab and specify the execution settings.

   For more on this, refer to [Execution settings](../../interaction/using/execution-settings.md).

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >Execution settings are only available if you are using Interaction with Campaign.

1. Specify the simulation scope.

   For more on this, refer to [Definition of the scope](../../interaction/using/simulation-scope.md#definition-of-the-scope).
