# Offers on an outbound channel{#offers-on-an-outbound-channel}

 

## Email offer delivery {#email-offer-delivery}

In our database, there is a category of travel offers to Africa. The eligibility, contexts and representations of each offer have been configured. We now want to create a campaign to present our offers via email.

1. Create a marketing campaign and a targeting workflow.

1. Click the **[!UICONTROL Edit]** tab, then **[!UICONTROL Scope]**.

   ![](assets/offer_simulation_example_004.png)

1. Choose the category for which you want to simulate offers.

   ![](assets/offer_simulation_example_005.png)

1. Choose the offer space to be used for the simulation.

   ![](assets/offer_simulation_example_006.png)

1. Enter validity dates. You must at least enter a start date. This lets the offer engine filter offers and choose those which are valid on a given date. 
1. If necessary, specify one or several themes to restrict the number of offers to those which contain this keyword in their settings.

   In our example, the **Travel** category contains two sub-categories with two separate themes. We want to run a simulation for offers with the **Customers>1 year** theme.

1. Choose the recipients you want to target.

   ![](assets/offer_simulation_example_008.png)

1. Configure the number of offers to be sent to each recipient.

   In our example, the offer engine will choose the 3 offers with the highest weight for each recipient.

   ![](assets/offer_simulation_example_009.png)

1. Save your settings, then click **[!UICONTROL Start]** in the **[!UICONTROL Dashboard]** tab to run the simulation.

   ![](assets/offer_simulation_example_010.png)

1. Once the simulation is finished, consult the **[!UICONTROL Results]** for a detailed breakdown of propositions per offer.

   In our example, the offer engine has based the offer breakdown on 3 propositions.

   ![](assets/offer_simulation_example_012.png)

1. If necessary, you can change the scope settings and run the simulation again by clicking **[!UICONTROL Start simulation]**.
