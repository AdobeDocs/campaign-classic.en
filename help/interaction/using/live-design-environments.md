# Live/Design environments{#live-design-environments}



## Operating principle {#operating-principle}

Interaction operates with two types of offer environments:

* **[!UICONTROL Design]** offer environments that include offers that are being edited and can be altered. These offers haven't been through the approval cycle and aren't delivered to contacts.
* **[!UICONTROL Live]** offer environments that include approved offers as they are presented to contacts. The offers in this environment are read-only.

Each **[!UICONTROL Design]** environment is linked to a **[!UICONTROL Live]** environment. When an offer is complete, its content and eligibility rules are subjected to an approval cycle. Once this cycle is complete, the concerned offer is automatically deployed to the **[!UICONTROL Live]** environment. From this moment on, it will be available for delivery.

By default, Interaction comes with a **[!UICONTROL Design]** environment and a **[!UICONTROL Live]** environment linked to it. Both environments are pre-configured to target the built-in recipient table.

>To target another table (visitor table for anonymous offers or a specific recipient table), you need to use the target mapping wizard to create the environments. For more on this, refer to [Creating an offer environment](#creating-an-offer-environment).

Offer managers and the delivery managers have access to different views of the environment. Delivery managers can only view the **[!UICONTROL Live]** offer environment and use offers to deliver them. Offer managers can view and alter the **[!UICONTROL Design]** environment and view the **[!UICONTROL Live]** environment. For more on this, refer to [Operator profiles](../../interaction/using/operator-profiles.md).

## Creating an offer environment {#creating-an-offer-environment}

By default, Interaction comes with a pre-configured environment to target the recipient table (identified offers). If you wish to target another table (visitor table for anonymous offers or a specific recipient table), you need to apply the following configurations:

1. Place your cursor on the **[!UICONTROL Administration]** > **[!UICONTROL Campaign management]** > **[!UICONTROL Delivery mappings]** node. Right-click the delivery mapping you want to use (**[!UICONTROL Visitors]** if you want to use anonymous offers) and select **[!UICONTROL Actions]** > **[!UICONTROL Modify the options of the targeting dimension]**.

1. Click **[!UICONTROL Next]** to proceed to the next screen in the wizard, check the **[!UICONTROL Generate a storage schema for propositions]** box and click **[!UICONTROL Save]**.

   >If the box is already checked, uncheck it then recheck it.

1. Adobe Campaign creates two environments (**[!UICONTROL Design]** and **[!UICONTROL Live]** ) with targeting information from the previously enabled target mapping. The environment is preconfigured with the targeting information.

   If you have activated **[!UICONTROL Visitor]** mapping, the **[!UICONTROL Environment dedicated to incoming anonymous interactions]** box is automatically checked in the environment's **[!UICONTROL General]** tab.

   This option lets you activate anonymous interaction specific functions, particularly when configuring environment offer spaces. You can also configure options that allow you to switch from an "identified" environment to an "anonymous" environment.

   For example, you can link a recipient environment offer space (identified contact) with an offer space that matches a visitor environment (unidentified contact). In this way, different offers will be made available to the contact depending on whether this contact is identified or not. For more on this, refer to [Creating offer spaces](../../interaction/using/creating-offer-spaces.md).
