# Data buffer zone{#data-buffer-zone}

You can configure a data buffer zone to increase inbound Interaction performance by desynchronizing offer proposition calculations. This configuration is to be carried out in the instance's own configuration file (config-Instance.xml). For more on this, refer to [this section](../../installation/using/configuring-campaign-server.md#interaction-data-buffer).

>[!NOTE]
>
>This parameter is essential if you use Interaction with a distributed architecture.
