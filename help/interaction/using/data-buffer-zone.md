# Data buffer zone{#data-buffer-zone}

You can configure a data buffer zone to increase inbound Interaction performance by desynchronizing offer proposition calculations. This configuration is to be carried out in the instance's own configuration file (config-Instance.xml). For more on this, refer to [this section](../../installation/using/interaction---data-buffer.md).

>[!NOTE]

>This parameter is essential if you use Interaction with a distributed architecture.
