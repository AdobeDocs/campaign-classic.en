## Vertica on CentOS {#vertica-centos}

To configure [!DNL Vertica] on CentOS, follow the steps below:

1. Download the ODBC drivers for [!DNL Vertica]. [Click here](https://www.vertica.com/download/vertica/client-drivers/) and download the latest Linux RPM.

1. You then need to install unixODBC with the following command:

    ```
    yum search unixODBC
    yum install unixODBC.x86_64
    ```

1. If you have previously installed the [!DNL Vertica] Server, an ODBC driver will already be installed. In this case, update the drive as follows:

    ```
    #Switch to root
    sudo su
 
    #Install the package (add --force to update it)
    rpm -Uvh vertica-client-x.x.x-x.x86_64.rpm [--force]
 
    #Open odbcinst.ini
    vi /etc/odbcinst.ini
 
    #Add a section for Vertica and save
    [Vertica]
    Description = Vertica ODBC Driver
    Driver = /opt/vertica/lib64/libverticaodbc.so
 
    #Open odbc.ini
    vi /etc/odbc.ini
 
    #Add your DSN in ODBC Data Sources section, for example:
    [ODBC Data Sources]
    VMart = "VMart database on Vertica"
 
    #Add a DSN definition section below, for example:
    [VMart]
    Description = Vmart Database
    Driver = Vertica
    Database = VMart
    Servername = # The name of the server where Vertica is installed. Use localhost if Vertica is installed on the same machine.
    UID = dbadmin
    PWD = <password>
    Port = 5433
    
    #Cleanup
    #Remove the ODBC package
    rm vertica-client-x.x.x-x.x86_64.rpm
    ```

1. In Adobe Campaign, you can then configure your [!DNL Vertica] external account. For more on how to configure your external account, refer to [this section](#vertica-external).

## Vertica on Windows {#vertica-windows}

1. Download the [ODBC driver for Windows](https://www.vertica.com/download/vertica/client-drivers/). To install the driver for Windows, you will need to enable .NET Framework 3.5 or the installation wizard will try to automatically enable and download it.

    ```
    #Switch to root
    sudo su
 
    #Move or copy the downloaded file and change to /root
    mv vertica_9.3..xx_odbc_x86_64_linux.tar.gz /
    cd /
 
    #Uncompress the file you downloaded
    tar vzxf vertica_9.3..xx_odbc_x86_64_linux.tar.gz
 
    #Remove the tar.gz since it is not needed anymore
    rm vertica_9.3..xx_odbc_x86_64_linux.tar.gz
 
    #Open odbcinst.ini
    vi /etc/odbcinst.ini
 
    #Add a section for Vertica and save
