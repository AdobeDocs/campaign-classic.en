## About built-in packages {#campaign-standard-packages}

Built-in packages contain a set of features that can be installed according to your needs and depending on your contract. The full list of Campaign built-in packages is available below.

>[!CAUTION]
>
>You may only install packages corresponding the options mentioned in your license agreement.
>
>Installing a new package can impact all your platform: it must be tested and validated before final deployment.
>
>Once a package is installed, you cannot uninstall it.
>
>As a hosted or hybrid customer, contact Adobe to have a new built-in package deployed.

To install a built-in package:

1. Access the package import wizard from **[!UICONTROL Tools > Advanced > Import package]** in the Adobe Campaign client console.
1. Select **[!UICONTROL Install a standard package]**.
1. In the package list, check the packages you want to install.
   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >When a package is greyed out, it means that is already installed or it is not compatible with your instance. Compatibility is detailed in the table below.
1. Click **[!UICONTROL Next]**, then **[!UICONTROL Start]** to start the package installation.

   Once the packages are installed, the progress bar shows **100%** and you can see the following message in the installation logs: **[!UICONTROL Installation of packages successful]**.

1. **[!UICONTROL Close]** the installation window.

The packages are now installed.

### Message Center package {#message-center-package}

You must install delivery channels (Email, Mobile channel, Mobile App channel, LINE, etc.) before installing Transactional messaging (Message center package). If you have started an email-only Message Center project, and need to add a new channel afterwards, you must follow these steps:

1. Install the new channel, for example the **Mobile channel**, using the package import wizard ( **[!UICONTROL Tools > Advanced > Import package > Adobe Campaign package]**).
1. Import the file ( **[!UICONTROL Tools > Advanced > Import package > File]**), and select:

   ```
   \datakit\nms\[Your language]\package\messageCenter.xml
   ```

1. In the **[!UICONTROL XML data content to import]**, keep only the Message Center delivery template corresponding to the related channel. For example, if you have added the **Mobile channel**, keep only the **entities** element corresponding to the **[!UICONTROL Mobile transactional message]** (smsTriggerMessage) template. If you have added the **Mobile App Channel**, keep only the **iOS transactional message** templates (iosTriggerMessage) and **Android transactional message** (androidTriggerMessage).

### [!DNL LINE] channel setup{#line-package}

To set up the [!DNL LINE] channel, you must first install the [!DNL LINE] package.

In the context of a mid-sourcing configuration, you need to:

* Install the [!DNL LINE] package on both the Marketing and the MID instance

* Setup the [!DNL LINE] external account on the mkt instance to point to the mid instance by changing the delivery mode. [Learn more](../../delivery/using/line-channel.md#configure-line-external)

* Setup the [!DNL LINE] credentials in the external account on the MID instance. 

>[!CAUTION]
>
>The Message Center delivery templates for [!DNL LINE] channel will not be available if the Message Center packages are installed before [!DNL LINE].
