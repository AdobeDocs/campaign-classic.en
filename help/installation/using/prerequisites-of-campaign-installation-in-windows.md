# Prerequisites of Campaign installation in Windows{#prerequisites-of-campaign-installation-in-windows}

The technical configuration and software needed to install Adobe Campaign is presented in the [Compatibility matrix](https://helpx.adobe.com/campaign/kb/compatibility-matrix.html).

The Adobe Campaign server installation process for multi-instance usage is described below in [Installing the server](../../installation/using/installing-the-server.md).

The main steps are as follows:

1. Install the application server, refer to [Executing the installation program](../../installation/using/prerequisites-of-campaign-installation-in-windows.md#executing-the-installation-program).
1. Integrate with a Web server (optional, depending on the components deployed), refer to [Configuring the IIS Web server](../../installation/using/prerequisites-of-campaign-installation-in-windows.md#configuring-the-iis-web-server).

Once the installation steps are complete, you need to configure the instances, the database and the server. For more on this, refer to [About initial configuration](../../installation/using/about-initial-configuration.md).

>[!NOTE]

>When Adobe Campaign is deployed to a Windows environment, users with the necessary access rights can use UNC syntax (Universal.Uniform Naming Convention) for access paths during file manipulation on the network.
