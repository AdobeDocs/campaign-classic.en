# External accounts{#external-accounts}

Adobe Campaign comes with a set of pre-defined external accounts. In order to set up connections with external systems, you can create new external accounts.

External accounts are used by technical processes such as technical workflows or campaign workflows. For example, when setting up a file transfer in a workflow or a data exchange with any other application (Adobe Target, Experience Manager, etc.), you need to select an external account.

## Create an external account {#creating-an-external-account}

To create a new external account, follow the steps below. Detailed settings depend on the type of external account.

1. From Campaign **[!UICONTROL Explorer]**, select **[!UICONTROL Administration]** '>' **[!UICONTROL Platform]** '>' **[!UICONTROL External accounts]**.

   ![](assets/ext_account_1.png)

1. Click the **[!UICONTROL New]** button.

1. Select your external account **[!UICONTROL Type]** which one you want to create.
1. Configure the access to the account by specifying credentials depending on the chosen external account type.

   The necessary information is usually provided by the provider of the server you are connecting to.

1. Check the **[!UICONTROL Enabled]** option to activate the connection.
1. Click **[!UICONTROL Save]**.

The external account is created and added to the external accounts list.
