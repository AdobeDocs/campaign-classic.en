## Tracking indicators {#tracking-indicators}

This report combines the key indicators for tracking the behavior of recipients upon receiving the delivery. It gives access to delivery and reception statistics, open and click-through rates, generated click streams, web tracking as well as sharing activities to social networks.

>[!NOTE]
>
>Values calculated based on message opens are always estimates, due to the margin of error linked to emails in text format. The **[!UICONTROL Distinct opens/Sum of opens for the population reached]** indicators take this margin of error into account. For more information on tracking opens, refer to [Tracking opens](../../reporting/using/indicator-calculation.md#tracking-opens-).

![](assets/s_ncs_user_tracking_synth_report.png)

**[!UICONTROL 1. Delivery statistics]**

* **[!UICONTROL Messages to deliver]** : Total number of messages to be delivered after delivery analysis.
* **[!UICONTROL Success]** : Number of messages successfully processed.

**[!UICONTROL 2. Reception statistics]**

>[!NOTE]
>
>The related percentages are calculated based on the number of messages forwarded successfully.

* **[!UICONTROL Distinct opens for the population reached]** : Estimation of the number of targeted recipients having opened a message at least once. Clicks on unsubscription links and mirror pages are taken into account. 
* **[!UICONTROL Sum of opens for the population reached]** : Estimation of the total number of opens by targeted recipients. 
* **[!UICONTROL Clicks on opt-out link]** : Number of clicks on the unsubscription link.
* **[!UICONTROL Clicks on the mirror page link]** : Number of clicks on the link to the mirror page. In order to be taken into account, the link must be defined as such in the delivery wizard (tracked URLs). Refer to this [page](../../delivery/using/monitoring-a-delivery.md). 
* **[!UICONTROL Estimation of forwards]** : Estimation of the number of emails forwarded by the targeted recipients. This value is calculated by subtracting the number of distinct people and the number of distinct recipients who clicked in the email.

  >[!NOTE]
  >
  >For more information on the difference between distinct people and targeted recipients, refer to [Targeted persons / recipients](../../reporting/using/indicator-calculation.md#targeted-persons---recipients).

**[!UICONTROL 3. Open and click-through rate]**

This table of values shows the breakdown of deliveries, opens, clicks and raw reactivity per Internet domain. The following indicators are used:

* **[!UICONTROL Sent]** : Total number of messages sent on this domain. 
* **[!UICONTROL Complaints]** : Number of messages for this domain that have been reported as undesirable by the recipient. The rate is calculated based on the total number of messages sent on this domain.
* **[!UICONTROL Opens]** : Number of distinct targeted recipients for this domain who have opened a message at least once. The rate is calculated based on the total number of messages sent on this domain.
* **[!UICONTROL Clicks]** : Number of distinct targeted recipients who clicked in the same delivery at least once. The rate is calculated based on the total number of messages sent on this domain 
* **[!UICONTROL Raw reactivity]** : Percentage of the number of recipient who clicked in a delivery at least once compared to the number of recipients who opened a delivery at least once.

>[!NOTE]
>
>The domain names displayed in this report are defined in the itemized list used at cube level. To change, add or remove default domains, edit the **[!UICONTROL Domains]** itemized list and modify values and aliases. For more on this, refer to [this section](../../platform/using/managing-enumerations.md). The **[!UICONTROL Others]** category includes domain names that don't belong to any value of the itemized list.

**[!UICONTROL 6. Sharing activities to email and social networks]**

This section shows the number of messages shared on each social network. For more on this, refer to [Sharing to social networks](../../reporting/using/global-reports.md#sharing-to-social-networks).

## URLs and click streams {#urls-and-click-streams}

This report shows the list of pages visited following a delivery. 

![](assets/s_ncs_user_url_report.png)

You can configure the contents of this report by selecting: the score chart to be displayed, the time filter (since the action launch, over the first 6 hours following launch, etc.) and the data display mode (by label, by URL, by category - for more on this, refer to [this page](../../delivery/using/monitoring-a-delivery.md)). Click **[!UICONTROL Refresh]** to confirm your selection.

The following rates are displayed in the upper section of the report:

* **[!UICONTROL Reactivity]** : Ratio of the number of targeted recipients having clicked in a delivery, in relation to the estimated number of targeted recipients having opened a delivery. Clicks on the opt-out link and on the mirror page are not taken into account.

  >[!NOTE]
  >
  >For more information on tracking opens, refer to [Tracking opens](../../reporting/using/indicator-calculation.md#tracking-opens-).

* **[!UICONTROL Distinct clicks]** : Number of distinct people having clicked at least once (excluding unsubscription link and mirror page) in a delivery. The rate displayed is calculated based on the number of messages delivered successfully. 
* **[!UICONTROL Cumulated clicks]** : Total number of clicks by targeted recipients (excluding unsubscription link and mirror page). The rate displayed is calculated based on the number of messages forwarded successfully.

**[!UICONTROL Platform average]** : This average rate, displayed under each rate (reactivity, distinct clicks, and cumulated clicks), is calculated for deliveries sent over the previous six months. Only deliveries with the same typology and on the same channel are taken into account. Proofs are excluded.

The central table provides the following information:

* **[!UICONTROL Clicks]** : Number of cumulated clicks, per link.

**[!UICONTROL Target population]**

This section has two indicators:

* **[!UICONTROL Initial population]** : Total number of recipients targeted by the delivery. 
* **[!UICONTROL Messages rejected by the rule]** : Number of addresses ignored during the analysis when applying typology rules: address missing, quarantined, added to the block list, etc. For more information on typology rules, refer to this [page](../../delivery/using/steps-validating-the-delivery.md#validation-process-with-typologies).

* **[!UICONTROL New quarantines]** : Number of addresses quarantined following a failed delivery (user unknown, invalid domain). The associated rate is the ratio with the number of messages to be delivered.

## Hot clicks {#hot-clicks}

This report shows the message content (HTML and/or text) with, on each link, the percentage of clicks on links. Personalization blocks unsubscription links, mirror page links and offer links are taken into account in the total cumulated clicks but are not displayed in the report.

>[!NOTE]
>
>If your delivery contains offers (Interaction), a box appears in the part above the report displaying the percentage of clicks on the offers.

## Tracking statistics {#tracking-statistics}

This report provides statistics on opens, clicks and transactions.

![](assets/s_ncs_user_stat_report.png)

It lets you track the marketing impact of the delivery. You can configure how values are displayed by changing the timescale (1-hour, 3-hour, or 24-hour view, etc.). Click **[!UICONTROL Refresh]** to confirm your selection.

This report provides a table of values and a Pareto chart which display the time required for the delivery to reach maximum efficiency. The following indicators are used:

* **[!UICONTROL Opens]** : Estimate of the time needed to reach a percentage of the total number of messages opened. Emails in text format aren't taken into account. For more information on tracking opens, refer to [Tracking opens](../../reporting/using/indicator-calculation.md#tracking-opens-).

In order for a transaction to be taken into account, a transaction type webtracking tag must be inserted into the matching web page. Webtracking configuration is presented in [this section](../../configuration/using/about-web-tracking.md).
