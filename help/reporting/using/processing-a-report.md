## Saving an analysis report {#saving-an-analysis-report}

If you have the appropriate rights, you can save an analysis report created from a template or export it in Excel, PDF, or OpenOffice format.

To save your report, click **[!UICONTROL Save]** and give your report a label.

Select **[!UICONTROL Also save data]** if you wish to create a history of your report and see the values of the report at the time of saving. For more on this, refer to [Archive analysis reports](#archiving-analysis-reports).

The **[!UICONTROL Share this report]** option allows other operators to access the report.

Once it has been saved, this report can be re-used to generate other analysis reports: 

![](assets/s_ncs_user_report_wizard_08a.png)

To make changes to this report, edit the **[!UICONTROL Administration > Configuration > Adobe Campaign tree reports]** node of the Adobe Campaign tree (or the first 'Reports' type folder for which the operator has editing rights). For more on this, refer to [Configure the layout of a descriptive analysis report](#configuring-the-layout-of-a-descriptive-analysis-report).

## Analysis report additional settings {#analysis-report-additional-settings}

Once a descriptive analysis report has been saved, you can edit its properties and access additional options. 

![](assets/s_ncs_user_report_wizard_08b.png)

These options are the same as standard reports and are detailed in [this page](../../reporting/using/properties-of-the-report.md).

## Configure the layout of a descriptive analysis report {#configuring-the-layout-of-a-descriptive-analysis-report}

You can personalize the display and layout of your data in the charts and tables of the descriptive analysis. All options are accessed via the Adobe Campaign tree, in the **[!UICONTROL Edit]** tab of each report.

### Analysis report display mode {#analysis-report-display-mode}

When you create a report using the **[!UICONTROL qualitative distribution]** template, table and chart display modes are selected by default. If you only want one display mode, un-check the appropriate box. This means that only the tab of the checked display mode will be available.

To change the schema of the report, click the **[!UICONTROL Select the link]** and select another table from the database.

### Analysis report display settings {#analysis-report-display-settings}

It's possible to hide or show statistics and sub-totals as well as choose the orientation of your statistics.

![](assets/s_ncs_advuser_report_display_05.png)

When you create statistics you can personalize their label. 

![](assets/s_ncs_advuser_report_display_06.png)

Their name will be displayed in the report.

![](assets/s_ncs_advuser_report_display_07.png)

However, if you un-check the label and sub-total display option, they will not be visible in the report. The name will appear in a tooltip when you hover over a cell of the table.

![](assets/s_ncs_advuser_report_display_08.png)

By default, the statistics are displayed online. To change the orientation, select the appropriate option from the drop-down list.

* **[!UICONTROL Pivot]** to change the axis of the variable.

### Analysis report chart options {#analysis-report-chart-options}

It's possible to personalize the display of data in the chart. To do this, click the **[!UICONTROL Variables...]** link available during the chart type selection stage.

![](assets/s_ncs_advuser_report_wizard_3c.png)

The following options are available:

* The upper section of the window lets you modify the chart display area.
* By default, labels are displayed in the chart. You can hide them by un-checking the **[!UICONTROL Show values]** option.
* The **[!UICONTROL Accumulate values]** option lets you add up values from one series to another. 
* You can decide whether or not to display the chart legend: to hide it, un-check the appropriate option. By default, the legend is displayed outside the chart in the top right-hand corner.

  The legend can also be displayed on top of the chart in order to save on display space. To do this, select the option **[!UICONTROL Include in the chart]**

  Select the vertical and horizontal alignment in the **[!UICONTROL Caption position]** drop-down list.

## Re-use existing reports and analyses {#re-using-existing-reports-and-analyses}
