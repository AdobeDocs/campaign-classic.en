# Accessing reports{#accessing-reports}

Campaign built-in reports are grouped in the **Reports** tab of the Adobe Campaign interface.

Use the search fields to filter the displayed reports.

Then click the report you want to display.

The **Back** link at the top of the screen takes you back to the list of reports.

Other possible actions on a report being edited are detailed in [this page](../../reporting/using/actions-on-reports.md).

Reports that are specific to a campaign or a delivery are accessible via their respective dashboards.

The principle is the same for lists, services, offers, etc. as shown below:
